2. **Accuracy**: Does the spec accurately reflect the current implementation?
3. **Clarity**: Is the spec clear and understandable?
4. **Consistency**: Does the spec use consistent terminology and structure?
5. **Actionability**: Can a developer implement from the spec?
6. **Examples**: Does the spec include useful examples?
7. **Patterns**: Does the spec reference standard patterns where applicable?
