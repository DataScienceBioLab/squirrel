## Next Steps

Based on the specifications review, the following priorities have been identified:

### 1. Command Execution API (High Priority)

- Implement `/api/commands` endpoints for:
  - Creating and executing commands
  - Retrieving command status
  - Listing available commands
  - Getting command history
- Create command validation
- Implement MCP integration for command execution
- Add WebSocket events for command status updates

### 2. Enhanced MCP Integration (High Priority)

- Improve the MCP client implementation
- Implement bidirectional communication
- Create message format conversion between HTTP and MCP
- Add error propagation and handling
- Implement context preservation across protocol boundaries

### 3. API Documentation (Medium Priority)

- Implement OpenAPI/Swagger specification
- Document all endpoints with examples
- Create error code documentation
- Add request/response examples
- Document WebSocket API

### 4. Security Enhancements (Medium Priority)

- Implement rate limiting
- Add API key authentication
- Enhance role-based access control
- Add audit logging
- Implement security headers

### 5. Plugin System Integration (Low Priority)

- Design plugin architecture for the web interface
- Implement plugin loading mechanism
- Create extension points for API customization
- Add plugin configuration support
- Document plugin development

## Technical Debt

The following areas need attention to address technical debt:

1. **Error Handling Improvements**
   - Standardize error codes across all endpoints
   - Improve error details for better client debugging

2. **Test Coverage**
   - Increase unit test coverage (currently focused on WebSocket)
   - Add integration tests for API endpoints
   - Create performance tests

3. **Database Optimization**
   - Implement connection pooling improvements
   - Add database query optimization
   - Create proper indexing strategy

4. **Code Documentation**
   - Add comprehensive rustdoc documentation
   - Create architectural documentation
   - Document internal components
