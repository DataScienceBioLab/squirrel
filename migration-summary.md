## Success Criteria

Most of our success criteria have been met:

2. âœ… All components now use explicit initialization
3. âœ… All tests are passing
4. âœ… Documentation has been updated with clear examples
5. âœ… Migration guides are available for developers

## Conclusion

The Dependency Injection migration has been largely successful. We have systematically removed all global state from the codebase and implemented proper dependency injection patterns across all modules. The codebase now follows consistent patterns for initialization, error handling, and resource management.

Minor improvements could still be made to enhance consistency, particularly in adding `is_initialized()` methods to a few components in the App module for complete consistency. However, these are not critical as the module already follows proper initialization patterns.

The migration can be considered substantially complete, with only final verification and minor consistency improvements remaining.
