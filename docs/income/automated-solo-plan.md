# Automated Solo Operation Plan

## Overview
This plan focuses on maximizing automation in our solo consulting practice, leveraging AI tools, MCP, and automated workflows to reduce manual work while maintaining quality. The goal remains generating $500-1000 monthly revenue with minimal active time investment.

## Automated Service Components

### 1. Automated Code Review Service ($150/hour)
- **Core Automation**:
  - AI-powered initial code analysis
  - Automated rule engine checks
  - Automated report generation
  - Security vulnerability scanning
  - Performance metric collection
  
- **Workflow**:
  1. Client submits code via GitHub repository
  2. Automated pipeline triggers:
     - Rule engine analysis
     - Security checks
     - Performance analysis
     - Documentation review
  3. AI generates initial report
  4. Human review for 30 minutes
  5. Final report delivery
  
- **Time Savings**: Reduce 4-hour review to 1 hour active time
- **Target Revenue**: Same $600-1200/month with 75% less active time

### 2. Semi-Automated MCP Integration Advisory ($200/hour)
- **Automated Components**:
  - Initial architecture analysis
  - Configuration validation
