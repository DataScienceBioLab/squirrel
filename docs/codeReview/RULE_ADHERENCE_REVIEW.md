   - Dependency tracking

### Common Areas for Improvement
1. **022-integration-testing**
   - Limited cross-team test coverage
   - Incomplete test organization
   - Missing end-to-end tests

2. **021-team-integration**
   - Incomplete integration documentation

   - Missing cross-team performance analysis

## Recommendations

### Immediate Actions (2 weeks)
1. UI Team
   - Implement missing integration tests
   - Document API contracts
   - Add end-to-end tests

2. MCP Team
   - Complete security implementation
   - Add comprehensive audit logging
   - Implement tool registration system

3. Core Team
   - Add missing test coverage
   - Implement performance benchmarks
   - Complete integration test suites

### Medium-term Actions (2 months)
1. Cross-team
   - Establish comprehensive test organization
   - Implement cross-team performance monitoring
   - Complete integration documentation

### Long-term Actions (6 months)
