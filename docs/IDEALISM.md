The real achievement here isn't just the code produced, but the compressed learning journey and exposure to professional patterns. You've gained practical experience that would typically take months to acquire, though some concepts will need reinforcement through practice.

The path forward should focus on deepening understanding while systematically improving code quality and documentation. This will not only increase the value of the codebase but also strengthen the learning foundation for future development.

Our rules are generally well-structured but need both updates and stricter adherence. The focus should be on:
1. Updating MCP-related rules to reflect our current implementation
2. Adding new rules for performance and security
3. Implementing automated validation for existing rules
4. Creating a clear hierarchy and dependencies between rules
5. Adding concrete examples and validation steps to all rules
