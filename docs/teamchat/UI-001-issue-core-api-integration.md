# UI-Core API Integration Issue: Button State Management

## From: UI Team
## To: Core Team
## Date: 2024-03-19
## Status: Open

### Summary
During implementation of the new button component, we discovered inconsistencies in how the core API handles state management for UI components.

### Details
In `src/components/Button.tsx`, we're seeing unexpected behavior when integrating with the core state management API:

```typescript
// Current implementation
const Button = () => {
  const state = useComponentState(); // Core API call
  // State updates are not reflecting immediately
  // Causing UI/Core sync issues
}
```

Specific issues:
- State updates take 2-3 render cycles to reflect
- Inconsistent behavior between development and production
- Memory leaks detected in React DevTools

### Action Items
1. Core team to review state management implementation
2. Add proper cleanup in useComponentState hook
3. Document expected behavior for UI components
4. Add integration tests for UI-Core state sync

### Impact
- Affects all UI components using core state management
- Potential performance impact in production
- Blocks UI team from completing component library

### Next Steps
1. Schedule technical discussion between UI and Core teams
2. Create reproduction case in isolated environment
3. Implement temporary workaround if needed
4. Plan long-term solution
