# Parallel Worktree Issue Resolution: IDE State Management

## From: DataScienceBioLab
### Working in: mcp worktree
### To: all worktrees
## Date: 2024-03-20

### Summary
Successfully identified and resolved an issue with Cursor IDE state management when working with parallel worktrees. This finding has significant implications for improving our development workflow and rule system.

### Findings
#### 1. Issue Description
- **Problem**: IDE state inconsistency when working with parallel worktrees
- **Impact**: Potential day of lost work without proper worktree management
- **Root Cause**: IDE state not properly synchronized between different worktree instances

#### 2. Technical Details
- IDE state needs to be properly managed when switching between worktrees
- Current worktree setup requires specific sequence of operations
- File system recognition and Cargo integration affected

### Action Items
1. Update rule `007-worktree-management.mdc` to include IDE state management
2. Add post-worktree-switch checklist to documentation
3. Implement automated worktree state validation
4. Create IDE state recovery procedures

### Benefits
- Prevents loss of work
- Improves development efficiency
- Reduces worktree-related issues
- Enhances cross-team collaboration
- Maintains clean IDE state

### Next Steps
1. Document IDE state management requirements
2. Update worktree management rules
3. Create automated validation tools
4. Train teams on proper worktree procedures

### Recommendations for Rule Updates
1. Add IDE state management section to `007-worktree-management.mdc`
2. Include post-switch validation steps
3. Document proper worktree initialization sequence
4. Add IDE-specific considerations
