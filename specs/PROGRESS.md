## Current Implementation Notes

The Squirrel CLI now has a robust plugin system, command execution capabilities, and a well-structured command interface. The CLI allows for dynamic loading of plugins and provides a unified command structure for both built-in and plugin commands.

The implementation of the Machine Context Protocol (MCP) command is in progress, which will enable communication between various components and services through the Squirrel platform. The MCP command will provide subcommands for server management, client operations, and protocol handling.

We've created a basic "hello" plugin as a demonstration of the plugin system functionality. This plugin adds a simple command to the CLI that greets the user, showing how plugins can extend the CLI's capabilities.

## Blockers and Issues

1. **Dynamic Library Loading**: Cross-platform dynamic library loading requires careful handling of platform-specific details.
2. **Error Propagation**: Ensuring proper error propagation between plugins and the core CLI.
3. **Plugin Isolation**: Preventing plugins from interfering with each other or the core CLI.
