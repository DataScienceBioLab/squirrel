## Current Crates Needing Specs Review

- web

## Review Process

Each specification or crate is evaluated according to the following checklist:

1. **Overall Architecture Review**
   - Component responsibilities
   - Interface design
   - Dependencies and coupling
   
2. **Alignment with Implementation**
   - Spec accuracy vs. current code
   - Missing functionality in spec or code
   - Inconsistencies to resolve
   
3. **Documentation Quality**
   - Completeness
   - Clarity
   - Examples and usage scenarios
   
4. **Testing Guidelines**
   - Coverage expectations
   - Testing strategies and patterns
   
5. **Future Development**
   - Planned enhancements
   - Known limitations to address
   - Compatibility concerns

## Individual Specs Reviews

### App and Core

- **Findings**: The app and core crates work well together with a clear separation of responsibilities. The core crate provides foundation types and utilities while the app crate implements the main application logic.
- **Gap**: Missing explicit documentation of the relationship between these two crates.
- **Action Plan**: 
  - [x] Create relationship document that shows how app and core interact (RELATIONSHIP.md)
  - [x] Document the layered architecture approach
  - [x] Clarify responsibilities for each crate

### Commands

- **Findings**: Command system is well-designed with good separation between command definition, execution context, and handlers.
- **Gap**: Need better documentation on how to add new commands or extend existing ones.
- **Action Plan**:
  - [x] Document command creation process (commands/README.md)
  - [x] Create examples of command implementations (commands/examples.md)
  - [x] Document command testing approach (commands/testing.md)

### Context

- **Findings**: Context management is robust but complex. Context and context-adapter crates have complementary responsibilities.
- **Gap**: Unclear relationship between context and context-adapter in documentation.
- **Action Plan**:
  - [x] Create relationship document for context and context-adapter (context/RELATIONSHIP.md)
  - [x] Document context lifecycle (context/lifecycle.md)
  - [x] Improve API documentation with more examples

### Integration

- **Findings**: The integration system has well-defined specifications for component interactions, but documentation needs updates for recent architecture changes.
- **Gap**: Missing implementation examples and standard integration patterns.
- **Action Plan**:
  - [x] Create a comprehensive review document (integration/REVIEW.md)
  - [x] Document standard integration patterns (integration/PATTERNS.md)
  - [ ] Update existing integration specifications to match current implementation
  - [ ] Create integration testing guidelines

### MCP Protocol

- **Findings**: Protocol is well-specified but implementation has evolved beyond documentation in some areas.
- **Gap**: Updated features are not fully documented.
- **Action Plan**:
  - [x] Update protocol specification with new message types (mcp/protocol.md)
  - [x] Document versioning and compatibility approach (mcp/compatibility.md)
  - [x] Create implementation guide (mcp/implementation.md)

### Monitoring System

- **Findings**: Monitoring system has a solid foundation with metrics collection, health checks, and alerting capabilities.
- **Gap**: Dashboard integration and network monitoring documentation missing.
- **Action Plan**:
  - [x] Create a comprehensive review document (monitoring/REVIEW.md)
  - [x] Create network monitoring specification (monitoring/04-network.md)
  - [x] Create dashboard integration specification (monitoring/05-dashboard.md)
  - [x] Document integration patterns (monitoring/06-integration.md)
  - [ ] Update overview document with current status and additional components (monitoring/00-overview.md)

### Plugins System

- **Findings**: The plugins system is well-specified with detailed documentation but remains primarily theoretical as the implementation is still in early stages (approximately 25% complete). The system is designed as a post-MVP feature with no dedicated crate currently implemented.
- **Gap**: Missing implementation details, testing framework, and standard patterns for plugin development.
- **Action Plan**:
  - [x] Create a comprehensive review document (plugins/REVIEW.md)
  - [x] Document standardized plugin implementation pattern (plugins/PATTERN.md)
  - [ ] Create skeleton implementation with core interfaces
  - [ ] Develop testing framework for plugins

### MVP Requirements

- **Findings**: The MVP requirements are well-defined and implementation is at an advanced stage (approximately 80-85% complete). The specifications clearly define core features, MCP functionality, and success criteria. The project is being rebuilt to ensure a more robust foundation.
- **Gap**: Missing integration verification, detailed testing approach, and user documentation.
- **Action Plan**:
  - [x] Create a comprehensive review document (MVP/REVIEW.md)
  - [ ] Develop integration verification plan
  - [ ] Create user documentation for MVP features
  - [ ] Establish post-MVP roadmap

### Patterns (Cross-cutting)

- **Findings**: There are several common patterns used across the codebase but not formally documented.
- **Gap**: Missing standardized approach to dependency injection, error handling, and async programming.
- **Action Plan**:
  - [x] Create pattern library in specs/patterns directory
  - [x] Document dependency-injection pattern (patterns/dependency-injection.md)
  - [x] Document error-handling pattern (patterns/error-handling.md)
  - [x] Document async-programming pattern (patterns/async-programming.md)
  - [x] Document resource-management pattern (patterns/resource-management.md)
  - [x] Document schema-design pattern (patterns/schema-design.md)
  - [x] Create a comprehensive README for patterns directory (patterns/README.md)

## Cross-cutting Concerns

### Dependency Injection

- **Findings**: Several approaches to DI exist in the codebase.
- **Action Plan**:
  - [x] Document recommended DI approach (patterns/dependency-injection.md)
  - [x] Create examples for common use cases

### Standard Patterns

- **Findings**: Need consistent patterns for error handling, async operations, and resource management.
- **Action Plan**:
  - [x] Document each pattern in the patterns/ directory
  - [x] Create a standard template for new patterns

### Integration Patterns

- **Findings**: Need standardized approaches for component integration.
- **Action Plan**:
  - [x] Document standard integration patterns (integration/PATTERNS.md)
  - [ ] Provide examples for each integration pattern
  - [ ] Create testing templates for integration points
