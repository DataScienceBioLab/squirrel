# Galaxy MCP Integration Specifications

## Overview

This directory contains the specifications for integrating the Machine Context Protocol (MCP) with the Galaxy Project ecosystem through a Rust crate adapter. The integration enables AI assistants to discover, execute, and orchestrate Galaxy's bioinformatics tools through a standardized protocol.

The integration is designed to leverage existing MCP and context crates from the Squirrel MCP project, implementing an adapter layer that connects these components to Galaxy. This crate-based approach significantly reduces development effort while ensuring consistency with the core MCP implementation.

## Specification Index

| Specification | Description | Status |
|---------------|-------------|--------|
| [Main Integration Plan](galaxy-mcp-integration.md) | Overall adapter architecture and implementation plan | Draft |
| [API Mapping](api-mapping.md) | Detailed mapping between Galaxy API and MCP | Draft |
| [Tool Definition Schema](tool-definition-schema.md) | Schema for representing Galaxy tools in MCP format | Draft |
| [Security Model](security-model.md) | Security approach for Galaxy adapter integration | Draft |
| [Workflow Management](workflow-management.md) | Specifications for workflow creation and execution | Draft |
| [Configuration Management](configuration-management.md) | Adapter configuration options and integration with existing config | Draft |
| [Deployment Guide](deployment-guide.md) | Integration guide for the Galaxy adapter crate | Draft |
| [Testing Framework](testing-framework.md) | Testing approach for the Galaxy adapter crate | Draft |
| [Version Management](version-management.md) | Adapter versioning strategy and dependency management | Draft |
| [Data Management](data-management.md) | Data handling approach for the Galaxy adapter | Draft |

## Key Features

- **Tool Discovery**: AI assistants can discover and understand Galaxy tools
- **Parameter Mapping**: Galaxy tool parameters are translated to MCP tool definitions
- **Execution Management**: Tools can be executed and their results retrieved
- **Workflow Automation**: Complex workflows can be constructed and executed
- **Security Controls**: Secure authentication with Galaxy API
- **Data Management**: Complete data handling from upload to processing
- **Configuration Flexibility**: Adaptable to different Galaxy instances
- **Comprehensive Testing**: Test infrastructure leveraging existing crates
- **Version Compatibility**: Clear versioning strategy for the adapter crate
- **Seamless Integration**: Works within existing MCP application architecture

## Implementation Approach

The Galaxy MCP integration is built as a Rust crate within the existing Squirrel MCP project structure:

```
project/
├── Cargo.toml (workspace)
├── crates/
│   ├── mcp/              # Existing MCP protocol implementation
│   ├── context/          # Existing context management
│   └── galaxy-mcp/       # New Galaxy adapter crate
└── examples/
    └── galaxy-workflow/  # Example workflows using Galaxy
```

This approach offers several advantages:

1. **Reuse of Existing Components**: Leverages proven MCP and context crates
2. **Reduced Development Effort**: Focus only on Galaxy-specific integration
3. **Consistent Behavior**: Maintains compatibility with other MCP tools
4. **Simplified Maintenance**: Core protocol changes only happen in one place
5. **Immediate Personal Use**: Can be used within personal workflows immediately

## Development Status

All specification documents have been updated to reflect the crate-based implementation approach. This simplifies the integration by leveraging existing MCP and context crates rather than building a standalone system. The implementation will proceed as a crate within the existing project first, with the option to extract it as a standalone project later if needed.

## Implementation Timeline

| Phase | Description | Target Completion |
|-------|-------------|-------------------|
| Phase 1: Specification | Create detailed integration specifications | Completed |
| Phase 2: Personal Implementation | Develop adapter as a project crate for personal use | Q2 2025 |
| Phase 3: Feature Completion | Implement all core functionality | Q3 2025 |
| Phase 4: Public Release | Prepare for public release (optional) | Q4 2025 |
| Phase 5: Production | Production-ready integration | Q1 2026 |

## Getting Started

For developers interested in contributing to or implementing the Galaxy MCP adapter:

1. Begin by reviewing the [Main Integration Plan](galaxy-mcp-integration.md) for a comprehensive overview
2. Understand the existing MCP and context crates in the Squirrel MCP project
3. Examine the [API Mapping](api-mapping.md) and [Tool Definition Schema](tool-definition-schema.md) for core functionality
4. Review the [Deployment Guide](deployment-guide.md) for integration considerations
5. Check the [Testing Framework](testing-framework.md) for quality assurance requirements
