# MCP Resource Management System

## Overview

The MCP Resource Management System provides comprehensive resource tracking, monitoring, and adaptive management for tools running within the MCP environment. The system ensures efficient resource utilization while maintaining system stability and preventing resource exhaustion.

## Purpose

The resource management system ensures:

1. Efficient utilization of system resources
2. Prevention of resource leaks and memory bloat
3. Graceful cleanup during unexpected tool failures
4. Performance optimization through resource monitoring
5. System stability through proper resource limits

## Components

### 1. Enhanced Resource Manager

The core component that combines basic resource tracking with adaptive resource management:

```rust
pub struct EnhancedResourceManager {
    tracker: ResourceTracker,
    adaptive_manager: Arc<AdaptiveResourceManager>,
}
```

#### Features
- Unified resource tracking interface
- Adaptive resource limit management
- Historical usage tracking
- Predictive resource allocation
- Automatic cleanup mechanisms

### 2. Resource Tracking

Basic resource tracking capabilities:

- Memory usage monitoring
- CPU time tracking
- File handle management
- Network connection tracking
- Resource limit enforcement
- Usage history maintenance

### 3. Adaptive Resource Management

Advanced resource management features:

- Usage pattern analysis
- Predictive resource allocation
- Dynamic limit adjustment
- Resource optimization
- Automatic scaling

## Resource Types

The system tracks and manages the following resource types:

1. **Memory**
   - Base limit: 100MB per tool
   - Maximum limit: 500MB per tool
   - Adaptive scaling based on usage patterns

2. **CPU Time**
   - Base limit: 30 seconds per operation
   - Maximum limit: 120 seconds per operation
   - Adaptive adjustment based on task complexity

3. **File Handles**
   - Base limit: 50 handles per tool
   - Maximum limit: 200 handles per tool
   - Dynamic allocation based on usage

4. **Network Connections**
   - Base limit: 10 connections per tool
   - Maximum limit: 50 connections per tool
   - Adaptive scaling based on connectivity needs

## Implementation Details

### Resource Usage Tracking

```rust
pub struct ResourceUsage {
    memory_bytes: usize,
    cpu_time_ms: u64,
    file_handles: Vec<u32>,
    network_connections: Vec<u32>,
}
```

### Resource Limits

```rust
pub struct ResourceLimits {
    max_memory_bytes: usize,
    max_cpu_time_ms: u64,
    max_file_handles: usize,
    max_network_connections: usize,
}
```

### Adaptive Management

```rust
pub struct ResourcePattern {
    average_usage: f64,
    trend: f64,
    seasonality: Option<Vec<f64>>,
    last_update: DateTime<Utc>,
}
```

## Usage Patterns

The system analyzes and adapts to the following patterns:

1. **Linear Growth**
   - Steady increase in resource usage
   - Gradual limit adjustments
   - Predictive allocation

2. **Burst Patterns**
   - Sudden spikes in usage
   - Temporary limit increases
   - Automatic cooldown

3. **Seasonal Patterns**
   - Time-based usage patterns
   - Predictive resource allocation
   - Pattern-based optimization

## Monitoring and Alerts

### Resource Status Levels

```rust
pub enum ResourceStatus {
    Normal,    // Within limits
    Warning,   // Approaching limits
    Critical,  // Exceeded limits
}
```

### Alert Thresholds

- Warning: 80% of current limit
- Critical: 95% of current limit
- Emergency: 100% of limit

## Integration

### Tool Manager Integration

```rust
impl ToolManager {
    pub async fn register_tool(
        &self,
        tool: Tool,
        executor: impl ToolExecutor + 'static,
    ) -> Result<(), ToolError> {
        // Initialize resource management
        self.resource_manager
            .initialize_tool(&tool.id, base_limits, max_limits)
            .await?;
        
        // Rest of registration process
    }
}
```

### Execution Flow

1. Tool registration with resource initialization
2. Resource limit setup (base and maximum)
3. Execution with resource tracking
4. Pattern analysis and limit adjustment
5. Resource cleanup on completion

## Best Practices

1. **Resource Initialization**
   - Set appropriate base limits
   - Configure maximum thresholds
   - Enable pattern tracking

2. **Usage Monitoring**
   - Track all resource types
   - Monitor usage patterns
   - React to status changes

3. **Limit Management**
   - Start with conservative limits
   - Allow adaptive growth
   - Maintain safety margins

4. **Cleanup Procedures**
   - Release resources promptly
   - Clean up on tool completion
   - Handle error cases

## Error Handling

### Common Scenarios

1. **Resource Exhaustion**
   ```rust
   if status == ResourceStatus::Critical {
       return Err(ToolError::ExecutionFailed(
           "Resource limits exceeded".to_string(),
       ));
   }
   ```

2. **Limit Violations**
   - Automatic throttling
   - Graceful degradation
   - Error propagation

3. **Cleanup Failures**
   - Retry mechanisms
   - Forced cleanup
   - Error logging

## Performance Considerations

1. **Monitoring Overhead**
   - Efficient tracking mechanisms
   - Batched updates
   - Optimized storage

2. **Pattern Analysis**
   - Asynchronous processing
   - Efficient algorithms
   - Resource-aware analysis

3. **Limit Adjustments**
   - Gradual changes
   - Hysteresis prevention
   - Performance impact awareness

## Future Enhancements

1. **Advanced Pattern Recognition**
   - Machine learning integration
   - Complex pattern detection
   - Automated optimization

2. **Resource Prediction**
   - Enhanced prediction models
   - Multi-factor analysis
   - Accuracy improvements

3. **Integration Improvements**
   - Better monitoring tools
   - Enhanced visualization
   - Advanced analytics
