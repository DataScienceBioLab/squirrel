# Network Monitoring Specification

## Overview
This document outlines the network monitoring component of the Squirrel monitoring system, focusing on tracking network activity, connection management, and protocol-specific metrics.

## Network Monitoring Components

### 1. Connection Metrics
```rust
pub struct ConnectionMetrics {
    /// Number of active connections
    pub active_connections: u32,
    /// Number of connection attempts
    pub connection_attempts: u64,
    /// Number of successful connections
    pub successful_connections: u64,
    /// Number of failed connections
    pub failed_connections: u64,
    /// Average connection time
    pub avg_connection_time: Duration,
    /// Connection error rate as percentage
    pub error_rate: f64,
}
```

### 2. Bandwidth Metrics
```rust
pub struct BandwidthMetrics {
    /// Total bytes received
    pub bytes_received: u64,
    /// Total bytes transmitted
    pub bytes_transmitted: u64,
    /// Current receive rate (bytes/sec)
    pub current_rx_rate: u64,
    /// Current transmit rate (bytes/sec)
    pub current_tx_rate: u64,
    /// Average receive rate (bytes/sec)
    pub avg_rx_rate: u64,
    /// Average transmit rate (bytes/sec)
    pub avg_tx_rate: u64,
}
```

### 3. Protocol Metrics
```rust
pub struct ProtocolMetrics {
    /// Messages received by type
    pub messages_received: HashMap<String, u64>,
    /// Messages sent by type
    pub messages_sent: HashMap<String, u64>,
    /// Protocol errors by type
    pub protocol_errors: HashMap<String, u64>,
    /// Protocol latency by message type
    pub message_latency: HashMap<String, Duration>,
    /// Protocol version
    pub protocol_version: String,
}
```

## Implementation

### 1. Network Monitor Implementation
```rust
pub struct NetworkMonitor {
    connection_metrics: Arc<RwLock<ConnectionMetrics>>,
    bandwidth_metrics: Arc<RwLock<BandwidthMetrics>>,
    protocol_metrics: Arc<RwLock<ProtocolMetrics>>,
    collection_interval: Duration,
    is_running: AtomicBool,
}

impl NetworkMonitor {
    pub fn new(config: NetworkConfig) -> Self;
    
    pub async fn start(&self) -> Result<()>;
    pub async fn stop(&self) -> Result<()>;
    
    pub async fn record_connection_attempt(&self, successful: bool, duration: Duration);
    pub async fn update_active_connections(&self, count: u32);
    pub async fn record_bytes_received(&self, bytes: u64);
    pub async fn record_bytes_transmitted(&self, bytes: u64);
    pub async fn record_message_received(&self, message_type: &str, size: u64);
    pub async fn record_message_sent(&self, message_type: &str, size: u64);
    pub async fn record_protocol_error(&self, error_type: &str);
    pub async fn record_message_latency(&self, message_type: &str, latency: Duration);
    
    pub async fn get_connection_metrics(&self) -> ConnectionMetrics;
    pub async fn get_bandwidth_metrics(&self) -> BandwidthMetrics;
    pub async fn get_protocol_metrics(&self) -> ProtocolMetrics;
}
```

### 2. Network Configuration
```rust
pub struct NetworkConfig {
    /// Collection interval in seconds
    pub collection_interval: u64,
    /// Maximum number of protocol message types to track
    pub max_message_types: usize,
    /// Whether to track per-connection metrics
    pub track_per_connection: bool,
    /// Whether to track protocol metrics
    pub track_protocol: bool,
    /// Export configuration
    pub export: Option<ExportConfig>,
}
```

## Collection Methods

### 1. Socket Statistics Collection
The system collects network statistics from active sockets:

```rust
async fn collect_socket_stats(&self) -> Result<SocketStats> {
    // Collect socket statistics from the operating system
    // This is platform-specific implementation
    // On Linux, this might use /proc/net/tcp and similar files
    // On Windows, this might use GetTcpTable2 API
    // Returns processed socket statistics
}
```

### 2. Protocol Inspection
For protocol-specific metrics, the system uses packet inspection:

```rust
async fn inspect_protocol_message(&self, 
                                message: &[u8], 
                                direction: MessageDirection,
                                timestamp: Instant) -> Result<()> {
    // Extract message type and other metadata
    // Record message statistics
    // Update protocol metrics
    // This is non-intrusive and doesn't modify messages
}
```

### 3. Rate Calculation
The system calculates rates over configurable time windows:

```rust
async fn calculate_rates(&self) {
    // Use sliding window algorithm for rate calculation
    // Update current_rx_rate and current_tx_rate
    // Calculate averages over longer periods
    // Trigger alerts on threshold violations
}
```

## Integration Points

The network monitoring component integrates with:

1. **MCP Protocol**: To collect protocol-specific metrics
2. **Alert System**: To trigger alerts on network issues
3. **Metrics System**: To export network metrics
4. **Dashboard**: To visualize network activity

## Performance Characteristics

1. **Collection Overhead**:
   - CPU impact: < 0.5% per active connection
   - Memory usage: < 2KB per tracked connection
   - Collection interval: Configurable, default 5 seconds

2. **Scaling Characteristics**:
   - Supports monitoring up to 1000 concurrent connections
   - Automatic sampling for high-connection scenarios
   - Configurable tracking detail level

## Error Handling

1. **Collection Errors**:
   - Failed collections are logged but don't interrupt monitoring
   - Automatic retry with backoff for transient errors
   - Graceful degradation of detail level under high load

2. **Resource Constraints**:
   - Memory limits for tracking data structures
   - Automatic pruning of oldest data when approaching limits
   - Warning alerts when approaching resource limits

## Testing Strategy

1. **Unit Tests**:
   - Test metric recording functions
   - Test rate calculations
   - Test error handling paths

2. **Integration Tests**:
   - Test with simulated network traffic
   - Test with protocol message mocks
   - Test concurrent connection handling

3. **Performance Tests**:
   - Measure overhead under various loads
   - Test scalability with increasing connections
   - Validate resource consumption limits

## Success Criteria

## Future Enhancements

   - Anomaly detection for network behavior
   - Capacity planning based on network usage patterns

## Migration Guide

For components integrating with network monitoring:

1. Add network monitoring configuration:
   ```rust
   let network_config = NetworkConfig {
       collection_interval: 5,
       max_message_types: 100,
       track_per_connection: true,
       track_protocol: true,
       export: Some(ExportConfig { /* ... */ }),
   };
   ```

2. Initialize the network monitor:
   ```rust
   let network_monitor = NetworkMonitor::new(network_config);
   network_monitor.start().await?;
   ```

3. Instrument your network code:
   ```rust
   // Record connection attempt
   network_monitor.record_connection_attempt(true, connection_duration).await;
   
   // Record data transfer
   network_monitor.record_bytes_received(message.len() as u64).await;
   
   // Record protocol message
   network_monitor.record_message_received("command", message.len() as u64).await;
   ```
