# Plugin State Persistence Specification

## Overview
The plugin state persistence system provides a flexible framework for storing and retrieving plugin state across application sessions. It enables plugins to maintain their state between application restarts and ensures data consistency.

## Team Responsibilities

### Core Team (src/core)
- Plugin state persistence architecture and interfaces
- State storage implementations
- State serialization and deserialization
- State versioning and migration
- State security and validation

## Plugin State Architecture

### Core Components

1. Plugin State Storage
   - File system storage
   - Memory storage (for testing)
   - Database storage (future)
   - Cloud storage (future)

2. Plugin State Manager
   - State serialization
   - State loading
   - State saving
   - State deletion
   - State listing

3. Plugin State Interface
   - State retrieval
   - State updating
   - State validation
   - State versioning
   - State migration

## Implementation Details

### Plugin State Storage Interface
```rust
#[async_trait]
pub trait PluginStateStorage: Send + Sync {
    /// Save plugin state
    async fn save_state(&self, state: &PluginState) -> Result<()>;
    
    /// Load plugin state
    async fn load_state(&self, plugin_id: Uuid) -> Result<Option<PluginState>>;
    
    /// Delete plugin state
    async fn delete_state(&self, plugin_id: Uuid) -> Result<()>;
    
    /// List all plugin states
    async fn list_states(&self) -> Result<Vec<PluginState>>;
}
```

### Plugin State Structure
```rust
#[derive(Debug, Clone, Serialize, Deserialize)]
pub struct PluginState {
    /// Plugin ID
    pub plugin_id: Uuid,
    /// State data
    pub data: serde_json::Value,
    /// Last modified timestamp
    pub last_modified: chrono::DateTime<chrono::Utc>,
}
```

### Plugin State Manager
```rust
pub struct PluginStateManager {
    /// State storage
    storage: Box<dyn PluginStateStorage>,
}

impl PluginStateManager {
    /// Create a new plugin state manager
    pub fn new(storage: Box<dyn PluginStateStorage>) -> Self;
    
    /// Create a new plugin state manager with file system storage
    pub fn with_file_storage(base_dir: PathBuf) -> Result<Self>;
    
    /// Create a new plugin state manager with memory storage
    pub fn with_memory_storage() -> Self;
    
    /// Save plugin state
    pub async fn save_state(&self, plugin: &dyn Plugin) -> Result<()>;
    
    /// Load plugin state
    pub async fn load_state(&self, plugin: &dyn Plugin) -> Result<()>;
    
    /// Delete plugin state
    pub async fn delete_state(&self, plugin_id: Uuid) -> Result<()>;
    
    /// Save states for all plugins
    pub async fn save_all_states(&self, plugins: &[Box<dyn Plugin>]) -> Result<()>;
    
    /// Load states for all plugins
    pub async fn load_all_states(&self, plugins: &[Box<dyn Plugin>]) -> Result<()>;
    
    /// Save plugin state directly
    pub async fn save_plugin_state(&self, state: &PluginState) -> Result<()>;
    
    /// Load plugin state directly
    pub async fn load_plugin_state(&self, plugin_id: Uuid) -> Result<Option<PluginState>>;
    
    /// Delete plugin state directly
    pub async fn delete_plugin_state(&self, plugin_id: Uuid) -> Result<()>;
    
    /// List all plugin states
    pub async fn list_plugin_states(&self) -> Result<Vec<PluginState>>;
}
```

### Plugin Manager Integration
```rust
impl PluginManager {
    /// Create a new plugin manager with file system state storage
    pub fn with_file_storage(base_dir: std::path::PathBuf) -> Result<Self>;

    /// Create a new plugin manager with custom state storage
    pub fn with_state_storage(storage: Box<dyn PluginStateStorage>) -> Self;
    
    /// Get plugin state
    pub async fn get_plugin_state(&self, id: Uuid) -> Option<PluginState>;
    
    /// Set plugin state
    pub async fn set_plugin_state(&self, state: PluginState) -> Result<()>;
    
    /// Delete plugin state
    pub async fn delete_plugin_state(&self, id: Uuid) -> Result<()>;
    
    /// List all plugin states
    pub async fn list_plugin_states(&self) -> Result<Vec<PluginState>>;
    
    /// Load state for a specific plugin
    pub async fn load_plugin_state(&self, id: Uuid) -> Result<()>;
    
    /// Save state for a specific plugin
    pub async fn save_plugin_state(&self, id: Uuid) -> Result<()>;
    
    /// Load state for all plugins
    pub async fn load_all_plugin_states(&self) -> Result<()>;
    
    /// Save state for all plugins
    pub async fn save_all_plugin_states(&self) -> Result<()>;
    
    /// Safely shut down the plugin manager, saving all plugin states
    pub async fn shutdown(&self) -> Result<()>;
}
```
