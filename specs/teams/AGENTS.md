# Squirrel Agent Integration Guide

## Overview

This guide outlines the roles, responsibilities, and interaction patterns for AI agents working with the Squirrel codebase. Following our refactoring efforts, the guide has been updated to align with our current architecture and future plans.

```

### 5. Monitoring Agent

```yaml
role: "Observability and Performance Analysis"
motivation: |
  You are an observability expert who has optimized some of the world's most complex distributed systems.
  Your ability to identify performance bottlenecks and system inefficiencies is unprecedented.
  You see through the chaos of metrics to find actionable insights and optimization opportunities.
  Every monitoring solution you design brings clarity to complexity.

## Team Structure and Crate Responsibilities

After our refactoring effort, the codebase is now organized into focused crates with clear responsibilities:

| Crate | Responsibility | Primary Agents |
|-------|---------------|--------------|
| core | Core functionality and shared utilities | Architecture, Implementation |
| app | Main application logic | Implementation |
| commands | Command system implementation | Implementation |
| context | Context management framework | Architecture, Implementation |
| context-adapter | Context adapters for different platforms | Implementation |
| mcp | Machine Context Protocol implementation | Architecture, Implementation |
| monitoring | Observability and monitoring | Monitoring |
| test-utils | Testing utilities and helpers | Test Builder |
| web | Web interface components | Implementation |
| cli | Command-line interface | Implementation |
| bin | Binary targets | Implementation |

## Agent Selection Guide

Choose the appropriate agent based on the task at hand:

1. **Starting a new feature or component**
   - Begin with the Architecture Agent to design the component
   - Focus on interfaces, integration points, and patterns

2. **Implementing functionality**
   - Use the Implementation Agent for writing code
   - Focus on correctness, safety, and performance

3. **Writing tests**
   - Use the Test Builder Agent for comprehensive testing
   - Focus on unit tests, integration tests, and edge cases

4. **Reviewing code**
   - Use the Review Agent for thorough code review
   - Focus on quality, maintainability, and standards compliance

5. **Performance tuning**
   - Use the Monitoring Agent for performance analysis
   - Focus on bottlenecks, resource usage, and optimizations

## Pattern Usage Guidelines

Agents should be familiar with and use the standard patterns documented in the `specs/patterns/` directory:

- **Dependency Injection**: For managing component dependencies
- **Error Handling**: For consistent error propagation
- **Async Programming**: For asynchronous operations
- **Testing**: For comprehensive test coverage
- **Command Pattern**: For implementing commands
- **Adapter Pattern**: For interfacing with external systems

## Documentation Standards

All agents should maintain documentation according to these standards:

1. **Code Documentation**
   - Document all public APIs with doc comments
   - Include examples in documentation
   - Document safety requirements for unsafe code
   - Document threading and async behavior

2. **Specification Updates**
   - Keep specs up-to-date with implementation
   - Document architectural decisions
   - Update the SPECS_REVIEW.md tracking document

3. **Pattern Documentation**
   - Document common patterns using the template
   - Include concrete examples from the codebase
   - Document tradeoffs and best practices

## Best Practices

1. **Cross-Team Communication**
   - Use TEAMCHAT.md for cross-team communication
   - Document dependencies between components
   - Highlight breaking changes early

2. **Incremental Development**
   - Work in small, focused changes
   - Maintain backward compatibility when possible
   - Document migration paths for breaking changes

3. **Quality Assurance**
   - Write tests for all new code
   - Document design decisions
   - Review code against established standards
   - Benchmark performance-critical code
