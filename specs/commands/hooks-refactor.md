# Hook System Refactoring Specification

## Overview
This specification documents the refactoring of the hook system in the squirrel-core crate, focusing on type safety, code organization, and maintainability improvements.

## Context
- **Team**: DataScienceBioLab
- **Component**: Core Hook System
- **Status**: Implemented
- **Date**: 2024-03-14

## Changes Made

### 1. Type Alias Introduction
```rust
pub type HookFunction = Box<dyn Fn() -> Result<(), Box<dyn Error>> + Send + Sync>;
```

#### Rationale
- Improves code readability
- Makes complex types more maintainable
- Follows Rust best practices for type organization
- Avoids suppressing clippy complexity warnings

### 2. HookManager Structure
```rust
pub struct HookManager {
    hooks: HashMap<String, HookFunction>,
    context: RwLock<HashMap<String, String>>,
}
```

#### Design Decisions
- Maintained thread-safety with RwLock
- Used String keys for hook identification
- Kept context data as string key-value pairs for flexibility

### 3. Dead Code Handling
- Retained `#[allow(dead_code)]` attributes where appropriate
- Removed `#[allow(clippy::type_complexity)]` in favor of type alias
- Follows project's dead code policy for work-in-progress components

## Benefits
1. **Improved Readability**
   - Complex types are now more manageable
   - Better code organization
   - Clearer type signatures

2. **Better Maintainability**
   - Easier to modify hook function signatures
   - Centralized type definition
   - Reduced cognitive load

3. **Enhanced Safety**
   - Proper thread-safety guarantees
   - Type-safe hook registration
   - Clear error handling

## Testing
- Unit tests cover:
  - Hook registration
  - Hook execution
  - Context data management
  - Thread-safety aspects

## Dependencies
- No new dependencies introduced
- Relies on standard library components:
  - `std::sync::RwLock`
  - `std::collections::HashMap`
  - `std::error::Error`

## Migration Guide
No migration needed as changes are internal to the implementation.

## Future Considerations
1. Consider adding typed context data
2. Potential for async hook support
3. Hook priority system
4. Hook lifecycle events
