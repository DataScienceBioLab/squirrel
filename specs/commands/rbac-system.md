# Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) System Specification

## System Overview
The RBAC system extends the existing authentication and authorization framework to provide fine-grained access control through role management. It enables assigning users to roles with specific permissions, simplifying access management and enhancing security.

## Implementation Status: ✅ COMPLETED

### Core Features
- ✅ Role definition and management
- ✅ Role assignment to users
- ✅ Permission mapping to roles
- ✅ Role-based authorization
- ✅ Role inheritance
- ✅ Role-based audit logging

### Role Structure
```rust
#[derive(Debug, Clone, Serialize, Deserialize)]
pub struct Role {
    pub id: String,
    pub name: String,
    pub description: String,
    pub permissions: HashSet<String>,
    pub parent_roles: HashSet<String>,
}
```

### Permission Structure
```rust
#[derive(Debug, Clone, Serialize, Deserialize)]
pub struct Permission {
    pub id: String,
    pub name: String,
    pub description: String,
    pub resource: String,
    pub action: String,
}
```

### Role Manager
```rust
#[derive(Debug, Clone)]
pub struct RoleManager {
    roles: Arc<RwLock<HashMap<String, Role>>>,
    permissions: Arc<RwLock<HashMap<String, Permission>>>,
    user_roles: Arc<RwLock<HashMap<String, HashSet<String>>>>,
}
```

## Integration Points
- Authentication System: ✅ Complete
- Authorization System: ✅ Complete
- Audit System: ✅ Complete
- Command Registry: ✅ Complete

## Best Practices
1. Follow the principle of least privilege
2. Design roles based on job functions
3. Implement role hierarchies appropriately
4. Assign users to roles, not permissions
5. Regularly review role assignments
6. Maintain comprehensive audit logs

## Implementation Guidelines

### Role Management
1. Define clear role boundaries
2. Implement role inheritance for hierarchical structures
3. Support role composition for complex permission sets
4. Provide role lifecycle management (create, update, delete)
5. Implement role assignment and revocation

### Permission Management
1. Define fine-grained permissions
2. Map permissions to resources and actions
3. Implement permission validation
4. Support dynamic permission evaluation
5. Prevent permission escalation

### Authorization
1. Extend the existing AuthManager with role checks
2. Implement permission-based command authorization
3. Support contextual authorization decisions
4. Provide authorization caching
5. Implement negative permissions (denials)

## API Reference

### RoleManager Methods
- `new()` - Creates a new role manager
- `create_role()` - Creates a new role
- `update_role()` - Updates an existing role
- `delete_role()` - Deletes a role
- `assign_role()` - Assigns a role to a user
- `revoke_role()` - Revokes a role from a user
- `get_user_roles()` - Gets all roles assigned to a user
- `has_permission()` - Checks if a user has a specific permission
- `create_permission()` - Creates a new permission
- `delete_permission()` - Deletes a permission
- `authorize_command()` - Authorizes a command for a user

### AuthManager Extensions
- `initialize_rbac()` - Sets up the RBAC system with standard roles and permissions
- `assign_role_to_user()` - Assigns a role to a user
- `revoke_role_from_user()` - Revokes a role from a user
- `get_user_roles()` - Gets all roles assigned to a user
- `authorize()` - Enhanced to check role-based permissions first

## Security Considerations
1. **Privilege Escalation**
   - Prevent circular role references
   - Validate permission assignments
   - Implement proper authorization checks

2. **Role Management**
   - Restrict role management to administrators
   - Audit all role changes
   - Implement separation of duties

3. **Persistent Storage**
   - Secure storage of role definitions
   - Backup role configurations
   - Version role configurations

## Future Enhancements
1. Dynamic Role Assignment
   - Time-based role activation
   - Condition-based roles
   - Context-sensitive roles

2. Role Request Workflow
   - Self-service role requests
   - Multi-level approval
   - Temporary role assignment

3. Advanced Auditing
   - Role change history
   - Permission usage tracking
   - Anomaly detection

## Implementation Results
The RBAC system has been successfully integrated with the AuthManager, providing fine-grained
access control through role management. The system now:

1. Allows creating and managing roles with permissions
2. Supports role inheritance for hierarchical structures
3. Provides user role assignment and revocation
4. Enhances authentication with role-based checks
5. Logs role-related operations for audit purposes
6. Prevents permission escalation through validation

Tests have been added to verify all functionality works correctly and securely.
