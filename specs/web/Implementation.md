## Dual-Mode Architecture

The Web Interface has been implemented with a dual-mode architecture to support different development and deployment scenarios:

### Database Mode (`db` feature flag)
- Uses SQLite database for persistence
- Requires database setup and migrations
- Full data model implementation
- Suitable for production use

### Mock Database Mode (`mock-db` feature flag)
- Uses in-memory storage with mock implementations
- No database setup required
- Simplified data models
- Suitable for development and testing

This approach allows developers to work on the API without requiring a full database setup, while ensuring the production system has proper persistence.

## API Standardization

A key focus of the current implementation has been standardizing the API response format:

```json
{
  "success": true|false,
  "data": { ... } | null,
  "error": {
    "code": "ERROR_CODE",
    "message": "Human readable message",
    "details": { ... } | null
  } | null,
  "meta": {
    "requestId": "unique-request-id",
    "timestamp": "ISO-8601 timestamp",
    "pagination": {
      "page": 1,
      "limit": 10,
      "totalItems": 100,
      "totalPages": 10
    } | null
  }
}
```

This standardization provides consistent error handling, metadata, and pagination support across all endpoints.

## WebSocket API Design

The implemented WebSocket API follows a subscription-based model:

### Connection
- Endpoint: `/api/ws`
- Authentication: Optional JWT token for authenticated connections
- Protocol: JSON messages over WebSocket

### Commands
The WebSocket API supports the following commands:

| Command | Description | Parameters |
|---------|-------------|------------|
| `subscribe` | Subscribe to a channel | `category`, `channel` |
| `unsubscribe` | Unsubscribe from a channel | `category`, `channel` |
| `ping` | Check connection status | optional `data` |
| `info` | Get connection information | None |

### Channel Categories
The following channel categories are supported:

| Category | Description | Example |
|----------|-------------|---------|
| `Job` | Job status updates | job:123 |
| `Command` | Command status updates | command:456 |
| `Notification` | System notifications | notification:user-123 |
| `User` | User-specific events | user:123 |
| `System` | General system events | system:alerts |

### Example Usage
```javascript
// Connect to WebSocket
const ws = new WebSocket('wss://api.example.com/api/ws');

// Subscribe to job updates
ws.send(JSON.stringify({
  command: 'subscribe',
  id: 'sub-1',
  params: {
    category: 'job',
    channel: '123'
  }
}));

// Listen for events
ws.onmessage = (event) => {
  const data = JSON.parse(event.data);
  if (data.event === 'job-status') {
    console.log('Job status updated:', data.data);
  }
};
```

## Challenges and Solutions

### Challenge: WebSocket Connection Management
**Solution**: Implemented a robust connection manager with thread-safe state management using `Arc<RwLock>`, allowing for concurrent access to connection data and proper cleanup of resources.

### Challenge: WebSocket Authentication
**Solution**: Integrated WebSocket connections with the existing JWT authentication system, allowing for both authenticated and anonymous connections with proper role-based access control.

### Challenge: Efficient Broadcasting
**Solution**: Implemented an efficient event broadcasting system with channel subscriptions, ensuring that messages are only sent to clients that have explicitly subscribed to specific topics.

### Challenge: Database Access in Different Modes
**Solution**: Implemented feature flags (`db` and `mock-db`) to conditionally compile different implementations of database access code, allowing for proper unit testing and development without database dependencies. The `mock-db` feature is now the default to simplify initial setup and development.

### Challenge: Consistent Error Handling
**Solution**: Created a standardized error response format with proper error categorization, ensuring consistent error responses across all endpoints.

### Challenge: Authentication Flow
**Solution**: Implemented JWT-based authentication with refresh token support, providing a secure and stateless authentication mechanism.

### Challenge: Middleware Complexity
**Solution**: Simplified the middleware approach by separating protected and public routes more clearly, reducing complexity and improving maintainability.

## Conclusion

The Web Interface implementation has made significant progress, with core authentication flows, job management functionality, and WebSocket real-time communication now complete. The dual-mode architecture provides flexibility for development and testing, while the standardized API format ensures consistency across all endpoints.

The WebSocket implementation enables real-time updates and notifications, which will significantly enhance the user experience, particularly for long-running jobs and system events. The subscription-based model allows clients to receive only the events they're interested in, improving efficiency.

The focus for the next phase of development will be on implementing command execution endpoints, enhancing security features, and creating comprehensive API documentation. These improvements will significantly enhance the usability and functionality of the Web Interface for both internal and external consumers.
