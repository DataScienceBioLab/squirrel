- [Patterns](specs/patterns/README.md) - Cross-cutting design patterns (100% complete)
- [Plugin System](specs/plugins/README.md) - Plugin architecture and development (75% complete)

## Specification Organization

The specifications are organized into several key areas:

1. **Core Architecture** - Overall system design and component interactions
2. **Component Specifications** - Detailed requirements for each system component
3. **Cross-cutting Concerns** - Security, performance, and other shared requirements
4. **Design Patterns** - Standardized implementation patterns used across the codebase
5. **Implementation Phases** - Timeline and prioritization for development

Each component directory contains:
- README.md - Overview and purpose
- REVIEW.md - Critical review of the component
- Detailed specifications for features and interfaces

## Documentation
- Each component has detailed specifications
- Implementation guidelines provided
- API contracts defined
- Testing requirements outlined
- Integration procedures documented

## Crates Organization

### Overview
The `squirrel/crates/` directory contains various crates that are integral to the squirrel project. These crates are designed to encapsulate specific functionalities and can be reused across different parts of the project.

### Key Features
- Modular design for easy integration
- Encapsulation of specific functionalities
- Reusable components across the project

### Usage Guidelines
- Each crate within the `/crates/` directory is self-contained and follows the standard Rust crate structure.
- Teams should refer to the `Cargo.toml` files within each crate for dependency management and feature flags.
- Direct interaction with these crates is not required unless specified in the project specifications.

### Integration Points
- The crates are integrated with the main workspace and follow the same versioning and dependency management rules as other components.
- Ensure that any updates to the crates are coordinated with the relevant teams to maintain consistency.

### Contact Information
For questions or support regarding the `squirrel/crates/`, please contact the Core Team at @core-team.
