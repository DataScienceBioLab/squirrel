# Monitoring System Overview

## Introduction
This document outlines the monitoring system architecture and requirements for the Squirrel MCP project, focusing on comprehensive system observability, performance tracking, and resource utilization monitoring.

## Core Components

### 1. Metrics Collection
- System metrics (CPU, Memory, Disk)
- MCP protocol metrics
  - Message processing
  - Latency tracking
  - Error rates
  - Connection management
- Tool execution metrics
  - Execution time
  - Memory usage
  - Success/Error rates
  - Concurrent executions
- Performance metrics
- Resource utilization

### 2. Performance Monitoring
- Command execution latency
- Message processing time
- Tool execution duration
- Memory usage patterns
- CPU utilization
- Queue depth tracking
- Connection pool status

### 3. Resource Tracking
- Memory allocation/deallocation
- File system operations
- Network I/O
  - Bytes sent/received
  - Active connections
  - Protocol metrics
- Thread pool utilization
- Connection pool status

### 4. Alert Management
- Performance thresholds
- Resource limits
- Error rate monitoring
- System health checks
- Critical event detection
- Alert routing and notification
- Alert history tracking

## Implementation Status

### Current Focus
1. Metrics System
   - âœ… Basic metric collection
