# Singleton to Dependency Injection Conversion

## Context
The monitoring system currently relies heavily on global singletons for various components. This design creates tight coupling, makes testing difficult, and can lead to hidden dependencies. We are undertaking a systematic conversion to dependency injection to improve maintainability, testability, and system clarity.

     - HealthCheckerFactory
     - MetricCollectorFactory
     - AlertManagerFactory
     - NetworkMonitorFactory
   - Removed global `MONITORING_FACTORY` static
   - Factory methods now use injected dependencies when available
   - Improved error handling and initialization flow

   Migration Guide for New Consumers:
   1. Use `MonitoringServiceFactory::with_dependencies()` for direct DI
   2. Or use `create_factory_adapter()` for adapter pattern
   3. Pass configuration through constructor when needed

   Next Steps:
   1. Monitor adapter pattern usage and gather feedback
   2. Plan for eventual removal of singleton pattern
   3. Update integration tests to cover new DI patterns
   4. Review and update related documentation

2. **System Information Manager**
   - Status: Complete
   - Priority: High
   - Current: Uses `lazy_static` for system info
   - Files: `crates/core/src/monitoring/network/mod.rs`
   - Dependencies: None

### Tool Components

1. **Tool Metrics Collector**
   - Status: Not Started
   - Priority: Medium
   - Dependencies: None
   - Current: Singleton via static references
   - Files: `monitoring/metrics/tool.rs`
   - Target: Dependency Injection via constructor parameters

## Migration Strategy - Implementing Deprecation

To encourage migration to the DI pattern, we'll mark global access functions as deprecated:

```rust
/// Get the notification manager instance
#[deprecated(
  since = "0.2.0",
  note = "Use dependency injection via NotificationManagerFactory::create_adapter() instead"
)]
pub fn get_manager() -> Option<Arc<NotificationManager>> {
    NOTIFICATION_MANAGER.get().cloned()
}
```

This will:
1. Provide a clear warning during compilation
2. Document the preferred alternative
3. Allow for a gradual transition
4. Guide new code to use the DI pattern

We should implement deprecation warnings for:
- Global `get_*` functions
- Singleton initialization methods
- Direct global state access points
- Factory methods that rely on global state

Responsible deprecation will ensure existing code continues to work while guiding towards better practices.

## Implementation Plan for Deprecation

1. **Phase 1: Add Deprecation Annotations**
   - Add `#[deprecated]` attributes to all global access functions
   - Include migration guidance in deprecation messages
   - Update documentation to highlight preferred patterns
   - Timeline: Next sprint

2. **Phase 2: Monitor Usage and Gather Feedback**
   - Track which components still use deprecated functions
   - Gather feedback from teams on migration challenges
   - Provide additional support for complex migrations
   - Timeline: 1-2 weeks after Phase 1

3. **Phase 3: Migration Support**
   - Create migration guides for common patterns
   - Provide helper utilities for transition
   - Support teams with specific migration needs
   - Timeline: Ongoing

4. **Phase 4: Eventual Removal Plan**
   - Develop timeline for future removal of singleton patterns
   - Create roadmap for complete DI adoption
   - Timeline: To be determined based on migration progress

## Implementation Strategy

For newly converted components, we have followed this pattern:

1. Create an adapter:
```rust
pub struct ComponentAdapter {
    inner: Option<Arc<Component>>,
}

impl ComponentAdapter {
    pub fn new() -> Self {
        Self { inner: None }
    }

    pub fn with_component(component: Arc<Component>) -> Self {
        Self {
            inner: Some(component),
        }
    }
}
```

2. Implement DI constructor:
```rust
impl Component {
    pub fn with_dependencies(
        config: ComponentConfig,
        dependencies: Arc<Dependencies>,
    ) -> Self {
        Self {
            config,
            dependencies,
        }
    }
}
```

3. Create factory methods:
```rust
pub struct ComponentFactory {
    config: ComponentConfig,
}

impl ComponentFactory {
    pub fn create_with_dependencies(
        &self,
        dependencies: Arc<Dependencies>,
    ) -> Arc<Component> {
        Arc::new(Component::with_dependencies(
            self.config.clone(),
            dependencies,
        ))
    }

    pub fn create_adapter(&self) -> Arc<ComponentAdapter> {
        create_component_adapter()
    }
}
```

4. Deprecate global access functions:
```rust
#[deprecated(
  since = "0.2.0",
  note = "Use dependency injection via ComponentFactory::create_adapter() instead"
)]
pub fn get_component() -> Option<Arc<Component>> {
    COMPONENT.get().cloned()
}
```

## Risks and Mitigations

1. **Backward Compatibility**
   - Maintain adapter pattern support
   - Keep existing global access methods during transition
   - Add deprecation warnings for global access

2. **Performance Impact**
   - Monitor metrics during conversion
   - Implement lazy initialization where needed
   - Profile critical paths

3. **Testing Coverage**
   - Add new tests before conversion
   - Verify all paths with integration tests
   - Monitor test coverage metrics

4. **Dependencies**
   - Document all component dependencies
   - Create dependency graphs
   - Plan conversion order carefully

The remaining component and integration testing will be completed by tomorrow, enabling a clean, maintainable monitoring system using dependency injection.

## Conclusion

The Singleton to DI Conversion project has successfully completed initial component conversions, with Dashboard Manager and Notification Manager now fully supporting the dependency injection pattern while maintaining backward compatibility through adapters.

With the demonstrated efficiency of AI-assisted development, we're now undertaking a complete migration of all remaining components to finalize this architectural improvement across the entire codebase within the next 2 days.

This approach will yield immediate benefits in terms of code maintainability, testability, and architectural clarity, while providing a clear migration path for consuming code. The backward compatibility layer ensures a smooth transition while encouraging best practices through compiler-enforced deprecation warnings.

Upon completion, all components will follow a consistent dependency injection pattern, laying the groundwork for further architectural improvements and making the codebase significantly more maintainable and testable.

## Removal Timeline

1. **Phase 1: Monitoring (Current - 2 weeks)**
   - Track usage of deprecated functions through logs
   - Identify all consumers still using global access
   - Create report of affected components

2. **Phase 2: Communication (2-4 weeks)**
   - Notify all teams of upcoming removal
   - Share migration guides and examples
   - Provide support for complex migrations
   - Set firm removal date

3. **Phase 3: Migration Support (4-8 weeks)**
   - Help teams migrate to DI pattern
   - Review and update integration points
   - Run automated checks for deprecated usage
   - Address any migration blockers

4. **Phase 4: Removal (Week 8)**
   - Remove all deprecated functions
   - Remove global state
   - Update documentation
   - Run final integration tests

## Recommendation

**DO NOT remove deprecated code immediately.** Instead:

1. Keep deprecated functions for one minor version cycle (0.2.x)
2. Follow the removal timeline above
3. Remove in version 0.3.0 as a breaking change
4. Document the removal in CHANGELOG.md

## Migration Verification

Before removing deprecated code:
1. Run static analysis to find usages
2. Check logs for runtime usage
3. Verify all tests pass without deprecated code
4. Test with major consumers

## Breaking Change Notice Template

```markdown
# Breaking Changes in v0.3.0

## Removal of Global Access Functions

All deprecated global access functions have been removed. Use dependency injection instead:

### Before:
```rust
let manager = get_manager().unwrap();
manager.do_something();
```

### After:
```rust
let factory = ComponentFactory::new();
let manager = factory.create_manager();
manager.do_something();
```

See migration guide at docs/migration/di-pattern.md for details.
