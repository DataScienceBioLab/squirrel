## Priority Actions

### 1. Complete Tool Management Implementation (Medium Priority)
The tool management subsystem has seen significant progress with the completion of resource tracking and adaptive resource management. The remaining focus areas include:

- **Tool Lifecycle Enhancements**
  - Complete the full lifecycle implementation (init, run, pause, resume, stop)
  - Add lifecycle hooks for monitoring and recovery
  - Implement proper cleanup procedures

- **Implementation Tasks:**
  ```rust
  // Enhance ToolLifecycle with hooks
  pub trait ToolLifecycleHook: Send + Sync {
      async fn pre_start(&self, tool_id: &str) -> Result<()>;
      async fn post_start(&self, tool_id: &str) -> Result<()>;
      async fn pre_stop(&self, tool_id: &str) -> Result<()>;
      async fn post_stop(&self, tool_id: &str) -> Result<()>;
      async fn on_error(&self, tool_id: &str, error: &MCPError) -> Result<()>;
  }
  ```

### 2. Enhance Security Features (Medium Priority)
While the security implementation is mostly complete, additional hardening is needed:
