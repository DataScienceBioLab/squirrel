## Recent Improvements (March 27, 2024)
1. Completed comprehensive resource tracking and cleanup system
   - Implemented granular ResourceUsage and ResourceLimits structures
   - Added automated file handle and network connection tracking
   - Implemented security-level-based resource limits
   - Added resource cleanup hooks for all lifecycle events

2. Implemented advanced error recovery strategies with RecoveryHook
   - Added progressive recovery strategy escalation (Retry → Reset → Restart → Isolate → Unregister)
   - Implemented recovery attempt history with success rate tracking
   - Added error-specific recovery mechanisms
   - Implemented intelligent strategy selection based on failure patterns

3. Enhanced tool lifecycle management
   - Implemented complete cleanup during tool deactivation and unregistration
   - Added emergency resource recovery for error states
   - Integrated RecoveryHook and ResourceCleanupHook with ToolLifecycleHook system
   - Added comprehensive unit tests for all resource management features

## Timeline
- Remaining tasks: Advanced security hardening, integration guides
- Expected completion: April 5, 2024
- Security audit date: April 10, 2024

## Implementation Highlights
- Trait-based design providing clear component boundaries
- Comprehensive error handling with recovery mechanisms
- Full async implementation with proper concurrency handling
- Adapter pattern for clean interface separation
- Factory pattern for simplified component creation
