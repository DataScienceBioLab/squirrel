# MCP Error Recovery Specification

## Overview

Error recovery is a critical component of the Machine Context Protocol (MCP) system, providing mechanisms to detect, diagnose, and recover from failures during tool execution. This specification outlines the design, implementation details, and best practices for the error recovery system within the MCP ecosystem.

## Purpose

The error recovery system ensures:

1. Graceful handling of tool execution failures
2. Minimization of system-wide impact from individual tool errors
3. Intelligent selection of recovery strategies based on error context
4. Progressive escalation of recovery approaches for persistent failures
5. Maintaining system stability and reliability through effective error management

## Components

### 1. RecoveryHook

The primary component implementing error recovery, this hook integrates with the tool lifecycle:

```rust
pub struct RecoveryHook {
    recovery_history: HashMap<String, Vec<RecoveryAttempt>>,
    current_recovery: HashMap<String, RecoveryStrategy>,
}
```

### 2. RecoveryStrategy

An enum defining the available recovery strategies, in order of escalation:

```rust
pub enum RecoveryStrategy {
    Retry,      // Simple retry with the same parameters
    Reset,      // Reset the tool's state before retry
    Restart,    // Deactivate and reactivate the tool
    Isolate,    // Isolate the tool from others and retry
    Unregister, // Unregister the tool completely
}
```

### 3. RecoveryAttempt

A struct tracking individual recovery attempts:

```rust
pub struct RecoveryAttempt {
    timestamp: DateTime<Utc>,
    strategy: RecoveryStrategy,
    successful: bool,
    error_context: Option<String>,
    resource_snapshot: Option<ResourceUsage>,
}
```

## Recovery Process

The error recovery system follows a progressive approach to handling failures:

### 1. Error Detection

Errors are detected through:
- Exception handling
- Timeout monitoring
- Resource limit violations
- Health check failures
- Protocol violations

### 2. Error Classification

Errors are classified as:
- Transient (likely to resolve with retry)
- State-related (requiring state reset)
- Structural (requiring restart)
- Isolation-related (requiring isolation)
- Fatal (requiring unregistration)

### 3. Strategy Selection

Recovery strategies are selected based on:
- Error classification
- Recovery history
- Current system state
- Resource availability
- Success probability

### 4. Strategy Application

Strategies are applied with:
- Proper resource cleanup before application
- Controlled execution environment
- Monitoring during recovery
- Timeout enforcement
- Success validation

### 5. Outcome Recording

Outcomes are recorded with:
- Success/failure status
- Performance metrics
- Resource impact
- System state changes
- Diagnostic information

## Strategy Details

### 1. Retry Strategy

- **When to use**: For transient errors (network glitches, race conditions)
- **Implementation**: Re-execute the failed operation with the same parameters
- **Success rate**: Typically 70-80% for transient errors
- **Resource impact**: Low
- **Timeline**: Immediate (< 50ms)

### 2. Reset Strategy

- **When to use**: For state-related errors (corrupt state, invalid state transitions)
- **Implementation**: Clear the tool's state, reinitialize, and retry
- **Success rate**: Typically 60-70% for state errors
- **Resource impact**: Medium (state reinitialization)
- **Timeline**: Short (< 200ms)

### 3. Restart Strategy

- **When to use**: For structural errors (resource leaks, deadlocks)
- **Implementation**: Deactivate the tool, clean up resources, reactivate, and retry
- **Success rate**: Typically 50-60% for structural errors
- **Resource impact**: High (full deactivation/activation cycle)
- **Timeline**: Medium (< 500ms)

### 4. Isolate Strategy

- **When to use**: For isolation-related errors (conflicts with other tools)
- **Implementation**: Move the tool to an isolated execution environment and retry
- **Success rate**: Typically 40-50% for isolation errors
- **Resource impact**: Very high (environment duplication)
- **Timeline**: Long (< 1000ms)

### 5. Unregister Strategy

- **When to use**: For fatal errors (unrecoverable failures, security violations)
- **Implementation**: Completely unregister the tool from the system
- **Success rate**: N/A (tool is removed)
- **Resource impact**: Complete (all resources reclaimed)
- **Timeline**: Final (no further recovery)

## Implementation Details

### Error History Tracking

Error history is tracked through:

1. Per-tool recovery history
2. System-wide recovery patterns
3. Temporal correlation of failures
4. Resource state during failures
5. Recovery success rates

### Progressive Strategy Selection

Strategies are selected progressively:

1. Start with the least intrusive strategy (Retry)
2. If failures persist, escalate to more intrusive strategies
3. Track consecutive failures to determine escalation timing
4. Consider system-wide impact when selecting strategies
5. Apply maximum retry limits per strategy

### Success Rate Calculation

Success rates are calculated based on:

1. Recent recovery history (weighted toward recent attempts)
2. Strategy-specific success patterns
3. Error type correlation
4. System state correlation
5. Resource availability correlation

## Performance Metrics

The error recovery system tracks the following metrics:

1. Recovery success rate (target: > 90%)
2. Average recovery time (target: < 250ms)
3. Escalation frequency (target: < 20%)
4. False recovery attempts (target: < 5%)
5. Resource impact of recovery (target: < 2x normal operation)

## Integration with Other Systems

### 1. Resource Management

- Coordinate resource cleanup during recovery
- Snapshot resource state before recovery
- Monitor resource usage during recovery
- Adjust resource limits based on recovery needs

### 2. Monitoring System

- Track recovery metrics for system health
- Generate alerts for recurring failures
- Provide historical recovery data
- Correlate failures across tools

### 3. Security System

- Ensure secure recovery procedures
- Prevent recovery-based attacks
- Audit recovery actions
- Enforce security policies during recovery

## Best Practices

### 1. Error Classification

- Implement specific error types and hierarchies
- Provide detailed error contexts
- Include stack traces where appropriate
- Correlate errors with system state

### 2. Recovery Strategy Selection

- Start with the least intrusive strategy
- Base escalation on failure patterns
- Consider system-wide impact
- Set appropriate retry limits
- Log strategy selection reasoning

### 3. Recovery Execution

- Implement proper resource cleanup before recovery
- Monitor recovery progress
- Set appropriate timeouts
- Validate recovery success
- Log recovery outcomes

### 4. History Management

- Maintain detailed recovery history
- Prune history to manage storage
- Analyze patterns to improve strategies
- Share insights across tools
- Use history for predictive recovery

## Testing Guidelines

### 1. Unit Tests

- Test individual recovery strategies
- Validate history tracking
- Verify strategy selection logic
- Test error classification

### 2. Integration Tests

- Test recovery during tool lifecycle events
- Verify system stability during recovery
- Validate recovery across multiple tools
- Test escalation patterns

### 3. Performance Tests

- Measure recovery timings
- Test system under high error rates
- Verify recovery success rates
- Validate monitoring accuracy

### 4. Chaos Tests

- Deliberately inject failures
- Test multiple simultaneous failures
- Verify recovery in resource-constrained environments
- Test recovery during system stress

## Conclusion

The MCP Error Recovery system provides comprehensive mechanisms for detecting, diagnosing, and recovering from failures during tool execution. By implementing this specification, the MCP system ensures graceful error handling, minimizes the impact of individual tool failures, and maintains system stability through effective error management.
