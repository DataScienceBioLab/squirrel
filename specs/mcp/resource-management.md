# MCP Resource Management Specification

## Overview

Resource management is a critical component of the Machine Context Protocol (MCP) system, providing tracking, monitoring, and cleanup of resources used by tools throughout their lifecycle. This specification outlines the design, implementation details, and best practices for handling resources within the MCP ecosystem.

## Purpose

The resource management system ensures:

1. Efficient utilization of system resources
2. Prevention of resource leaks and memory bloat
3. Graceful cleanup during unexpected tool failures
4. Performance optimization through resource monitoring
5. System stability through proper resource limits

## Components

### 1. ResourceUsage

The `ResourceUsage` struct tracks the following resources:

- Memory (in MB)
- CPU usage (percentage)
- File handles (count)
- Network connections (count)
- Execution time (in milliseconds)
- Temporary storage (in MB)

```rust
pub struct ResourceUsage {
    pub memory_mb: f64,
    pub cpu_percentage: f64,
    pub file_handles: u32,
    pub network_connections: u32,
    pub execution_time_ms: u64,
    pub temp_storage_mb: f64
}
```

### 2. ResourceLimits

The `ResourceLimits` struct defines thresholds for each resource:

```rust
pub struct ResourceLimits {
    pub max_memory_mb: f64,
    pub max_cpu_percentage: f64,
    pub max_file_handles: u32,
    pub max_network_connections: u32,
    pub max_execution_time_ms: u64,
    pub max_temp_storage_mb: f64
}
```

### 3. ResourceCleanupHook

The primary component implementing resource management, this hook integrates with the tool lifecycle:

```rust
pub struct ResourceCleanupHook {
    resource_usage: HashMap<String, ResourceUsage>,
    resource_limits: ResourceLimits,
    file_handles: HashMap<String, Vec<FileHandle>>,
    network_connections: HashMap<String, Vec<NetworkConnection>>,
    last_update: HashMap<String, DateTime<Utc>>,
}
```

## Lifecycle Integration

The resource management system integrates with the tool lifecycle at the following points:

### 1. Tool Registration

When a tool is registered, default resource limits are applied and tracking begins.

### 2. Tool Activation

When a tool is activated, resource tracking increases in frequency, and initial resources are allocated.

### 3. Tool Operation

During operation, resource usage is continuously monitored and compared against limits.

### 4. Tool Deactivation

When a tool is deactivated, resources are cleaned up, but tracking continues at a reduced frequency.

### 5. Tool Unregistration

When a tool is unregistered, all resources are cleaned up and tracking stops.

### 6. Error Conditions

During error conditions, special cleanup procedures are initiated to prevent resource leaks.

## Implementation Details

### Resource Tracking

Resource usage is tracked through a combination of:

1. Direct measurements for local resources
2. Handle tracking for external resources
3. Periodic sampling for usage trends
4. Event-based updates for critical changes

### Cleanup Procedures

Resource cleanup follows this sequence:

1. Close file handles in reverse order of opening
2. Terminate network connections with proper shutdown protocols
3. Free allocated memory
4. Release CPU resources
5. Clear temporary storage
6. Log cleanup actions for auditing

### Resource Limits

Resource limits are enforced through:

1. Continuous monitoring against thresholds
2. Warning notifications at 75% of limits
3. Throttling at 90% of limits
4. Cleanup at 100% of limits
5. Emergency shutdown if limits are exceeded by 150%

## Error Recovery

The resource management system coordinates with error recovery through:

1. Providing resource snapshots before recovery
2. Implementing specialized cleanup for different recovery strategies
3. Tracking recovery success rates
4. Adjusting resource limits based on recovery history
5. Logging detailed resource states for post-mortem analysis

## Performance Metrics

The resource management system tracks the following metrics:

1. Cleanup time (average: < 50ms)
2. Resource reclamation rate (target: > 95%)
3. False positive limit violations (target: < 1%)
4. Resource leak detection accuracy (target: > 99%)
5. Recovery success rate (target: > 90%)

## Best Practices

### 1. Resource Tracking

- Implement resource tracking at both coarse and fine-grained levels
- Sample resource usage at appropriate intervals
- Track resource trends over time
- Correlate resource usage with tool operations

### 2. Resource Cleanup

- Implement proper cleanup in all exit paths
- Use RAII patterns where appropriate
- Validate successful cleanup
- Log cleanup failures for investigation

### 3. Resource Limits

- Set appropriate limits based on system capabilities
- Adjust limits based on historical usage
- Implement graduated responses to limit violations
- Document limit reasoning and adjustments

### 4. Recovery Integration

- Coordinate cleanup with recovery strategies
- Prioritize critical resource cleanup
- Implement idempotent cleanup operations
- Provide cleanup status to recovery system

## Integration with Other Systems

### 1. Monitoring System

- Expose resource metrics to monitoring
- Generate alerts for resource issues
- Provide historical resource usage data
- Track cleanup performance

### 2. Security System

- Ensure secure resource cleanup
- Prevent resource-based attacks
- Audit resource usage for anomalies
- Enforce resource isolation between tools

### 3. Context Management

- Track resource usage per context
- Clean up resources when contexts change
- Associate resources with appropriate contexts
- Manage shared resources between contexts

## Testing Guidelines

### 1. Unit Tests

- Test individual cleanup operations
- Validate resource tracking accuracy
- Verify limit enforcement
- Test error conditions and recovery

### 2. Integration Tests

- Test cleanup during tool lifecycle events
- Verify system stability under resource pressure
- Validate multi-tool resource management
- Test recovery scenarios

### 3. Performance Tests

- Measure cleanup timings
- Test system under high resource load
- Verify resource reclamation efficiency
- Validate monitoring overhead

## Conclusion

The MCP Resource Management system provides comprehensive tracking, monitoring, and cleanup of resources used by tools throughout their lifecycle. By implementing this specification, the MCP system ensures efficient resource utilization, prevents resource leaks, and maintains system stability even during error conditions.
