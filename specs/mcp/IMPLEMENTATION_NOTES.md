# MCP Command Implementation Notes

## Current Status

The Machine Context Protocol (MCP) command is currently in an initial implementation phase. The command structure and interfaces have been defined, but the actual functionality is not yet implemented.

## Implemented Components

1. **Command Structure**: The basic command structure has been implemented with the following subcommands:
   - `server`: Start an MCP server
   - `client`: Connect to an MCP server
   - `status`: Check MCP server status
   - `protocol`: Manage MCP protocol operations (validate, generate, convert)

2. **Command Registration**: The MCP command has been registered with the command registry and integrated with the CLI.

3. **Argument Parsing**: Argument parsing for all subcommands has been implemented, including:
   - Host and port configuration for server and client
   - Timeout and interactive mode for client
   - File and content input for protocol operations
   - Version specifications for protocol conversions

## Next Steps

1. **Server Implementation**:
   - Implement WebSocket server functionality
   - Add protocol handlers for different message types
   - Implement authentication and authorization
   - Add support for both synchronous and asynchronous messaging

2. **Client Implementation**:
   - Implement WebSocket client functionality
   - Add message formatting and parsing
   - Implement interactive mode with command history
   - Add support for multiple connection profiles

3. **Protocol Management**:
   - Implement JSON Schema validation for messages
   - Create template generators for common message types
   - Add version conversion functionality
   - Implement protocol extension capabilities

4. **Integration with Plugins**:
   - Define plugin API for extending MCP functionality
   - Add hooks for message processing
   - Support plugin-specific protocol extensions

## Technical Considerations

1. **WebSocket Protocol**: The MCP implementation will use WebSockets for communication, requiring:
   - Proper error handling for connection issues
   - Implementing reconnection logic
   - Handling message framing and fragmentation

2. **Performance**: As MCP may handle high-volume message traffic, performance considerations include:
   - Efficient message serialization/deserialization
   - Minimizing memory allocations
   - Using async I/O effectively
   - Implementing message batching where appropriate

3. **Security**: Security considerations for MCP include:
   - TLS/SSL for secure connections
   - Authentication for clients and servers
   - Authorization for commands and operations
   - Input validation to prevent attacks

4. **Extensibility**: The MCP implementation should be extensible to support:
   - Custom message types
   - Protocol versions and extensions
   - Different serialization formats
   - Plugin-specific functionality

## Integration with Core CLI

The MCP command has been integrated with the core CLI through:

1. Command registration in the command registry
2. Consistent argument parsing with other commands
3. Using the same output formatting system
4. Following the same error handling patterns

## Testing Strategy

The testing strategy for MCP will include:

1. **Unit Tests**: Testing individual components in isolation
2. **Integration Tests**: Testing communication between client and server
3. **End-to-End Tests**: Testing the full MCP workflow
4. **Performance Tests**: Ensuring the MCP implementation can handle expected loads
5. **Security Tests**: Verifying that security measures are effective
