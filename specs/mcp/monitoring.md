# MCP Monitoring System Specification

## Overview
The MCP Monitoring System is responsible for collecting, analyzing, and reporting metrics, logs, and events across the MCP framework. It provides comprehensive observability and monitoring capabilities for all MCP components.

## Core Features

### 1. Metrics Collection
- Performance metrics
- Resource usage
- Error rates
- Response times
- Health checks

### 2. Logging System
- Structured logging
- Log levels
- Log rotation
- Log aggregation
- Log analysis

### 3. Event Tracking
- System events
- Security events
- User events
- Error events
- Audit events

## Implementation Details

### 1. Monitoring Structure
```rust
pub struct MonitoringSystem {
    pub metrics_collector: MetricsCollector,
    pub logging_system: LoggingSystem,
    pub event_tracker: EventTracker,
    pub alert_manager: AlertManager,
}

pub struct MetricsCollector {
    pub metrics: HashMap<String, Metric>,
    pub collection_interval: Duration,
    pub retention_period: Duration,
    pub storage: MetricsStorage,
}

pub struct LoggingSystem {
    pub log_level: LogLevel,
    pub log_format: LogFormat,
    pub log_rotation: LogRotation,
    pub log_storage: LogStorage,
}
```

### 2. Monitoring Operations
```rust
pub trait MonitoringSystem {
    fn collect_metrics(&self) -> Result<Vec<Metric>>;
    fn log_event(&self, event: LogEvent) -> Result<()>;
    fn track_event(&self, event: SystemEvent) -> Result<()>;
    fn check_alerts(&self) -> Result<Vec<Alert>>;
    fn generate_report(&self) -> Result<MonitoringReport>;
}
```

### 3. Alert System
```rust
pub struct AlertManager {
    pub alerts: Vec<Alert>,
    pub alert_rules: Vec<AlertRule>,
    pub notification_channels: Vec<NotificationChannel>,
    pub alert_history: Vec<AlertHistory>,
}

pub struct Alert {
    pub id: String,
    pub severity: AlertSeverity,
    pub source: String,
    pub message: String,
    pub timestamp: DateTime<Utc>,
    pub status: AlertStatus,
    pub details: HashMap<String, Value>,
}
```

## Monitoring Requirements

### 1. Metrics Collection
- Performance tracking
- Resource monitoring

## Error Handling

### 1. Error Types
```rust
pub enum MonitoringError {
    CollectionError(String),
    StorageError(String),
    AnalysisError(String),
    AlertError(String),
    NotificationError(String),
}
```

### 2. Error Recovery
- Data recovery
- Storage recovery
- Alert recovery
- Notification retry
- Error reporting

## Testing Requirements

### 1. Functional Testing
- Metrics collection
