# Error Recovery System Specification

## Overview
The error recovery system provides robust state recovery, snapshot management, and resilience strategies for the Groundhog AI Coding Assistant. It ensures reliable state restoration, efficient snapshot handling, and flexible recovery options.

## Core Components

### 1. Recovery Strategies
```rust
pub trait RecoveryStrategy {
    fn select_state<'a>(&self, snapshots: &'a [ContextSnapshot]) -> Option<&'a ContextSnapshot>;
}

pub struct LatestVersionStrategy;
pub struct SpecificVersionStrategy {
    version: u64,
}
pub struct TimeBasedStrategy {
    timestamp: SystemTime,
}
```

#### Strategy Features
- Version-based recovery
- Time-based recovery
- Custom strategy support
- Flexible state selection
- Error handling

### 2. Recovery Manager
```rust
pub struct RecoveryManager {
    persistence: Arc<Mutex<ContextPersistence>>,
    snapshots: VecDeque<ContextSnapshot>,
    max_snapshots: usize,
}
```

#### Manager Capabilities
- Snapshot creation and management
- State restoration
- Strategy-based recovery
- Error handling
- Resource management

### 3. Snapshot Management
```rust
pub struct ContextSnapshot {
    pub id: String,
    pub timestamp: SystemTime,
    pub state: ContextState,
    pub metadata: Option<serde_json::Value>,
}
```

#### Snapshot Features
- Unique identification
- Timestamp tracking
- State preservation
- Metadata support
- Version control

## Recovery Strategies

### 1. Latest Version Strategy
- Selects most recent state version
- Fast recovery option
- Default fallback strategy
- Version comparison
- Null safety handling

### 2. Specific Version Strategy
- Targets exact version
- Version validation
- Error handling for missing versions
- State verification
- Recovery confirmation

### 3. Time-Based Strategy
- Temporal state selection
- Timestamp validation
- Nearest match selection
- Time range support
- UTC normalization

## Implementation Guidelines

### Snapshot Management
1. Snapshots must be immutable
2. Snapshot creation must be atomic
3. Metadata must be preserved
4. Version tracking must be reliable
5. Cleanup must be managed

### Recovery Process
1. Strategy selection must be validated
2. State restoration must be atomic
3. Error handling must be comprehensive
4. Resource cleanup must be guaranteed
5. Recovery must be logged

### Error Handling
1. All errors must be categorized
2. Recovery attempts must be tracked
3. Error context must be preserved
4. Fallback options must be available
5. Error notifications must be sent

## Performance Requirements

### Response Times
- Snapshot creation: < 100ms
- State restoration: < 200ms
- Strategy execution: < 50ms
- Error handling: < 100ms
- Cleanup: < 100ms

### Resource Usage
- Memory per snapshot: < 1MB
- Total snapshot storage: < 100MB
- Recovery overhead: < 50MB
- Error context: < 10KB

## Security Considerations

### Data Protection
1. Snapshots must be secured
2. Recovery must be authenticated
3. Version access must be controlled
4. Metadata must be protected

### Audit Trail
1. Recovery attempts must be logged
2. Snapshot access must be tracked
3. Error events must be recorded
4. Strategy usage must be monitored

## Testing Requirements

### Unit Tests
1. All strategies must be tested
2. Snapshot management must be verified
3. Error handling must be validated
4. Resource management must be tested

### Integration Tests
1. Recovery flow must be tested
2. Strategy interaction must be verified
3. Error propagation must be tested
4. Resource cleanup must be validated

### Performance Tests
1. Response times must be verified
2. Resource usage must be monitored
3. Concurrent recovery must be tested
4. Error handling performance must be measured

## Monitoring Requirements

### Metrics
1. Recovery success rates
2. Strategy performance
3. Resource utilization
4. Error frequency
5. Snapshot statistics

### Logging
1. Recovery events
2. Strategy selection
3. Error occurrences
4. Performance metrics
5. Security events

## Documentation Requirements

### Strategy Documentation

2. Selection criteria
3. Error handling
4. Performance characteristics
5. Resource requirements

### Recovery Documentation
1. Recovery process flow
2. Error handling procedures
