# Squirrel Terminal UI Specifications

## Overview

This directory contains specifications and documentation for the terminal-based user interface of the Squirrel AI Coding Assistant. The UI implementation uses the Ratatui framework to create a responsive, efficient terminal UI that integrates with Squirrel's core functionality.

## Purpose

The Squirrel Terminal UI aims to provide:

1. An efficient command-line interface for interacting with the Squirrel AI
2. Visualization of context, code, and conversational data
3. Real-time feedback on tool execution and operations
4. A consistent and intuitive user experience across platforms
5. Accessibility for users with different requirements

## Design Philosophy

The Squirrel Terminal UI follows these core principles:

- **Efficiency First**: Optimize for speed, minimal resource usage, and keyboard-driven workflows
- **Progressive Disclosure**: Simple interface with advanced capabilities available when needed
- **Contextual Awareness**: UI adapts to show relevant information based on current tasks
- **Consistent Mental Model**: UI elements behave predictably and follow consistent patterns
- **Accessibility**: Support for different user needs and preferences

## Documentation Structure

This directory contains the following documentation:

| File | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `README.md` | This overview document |
| `ratatui-integration.md` | Technical specification for integrating Ratatui |
| `component-architecture.md` | Defines the UI component architecture and relationships |
| `implementation-roadmap.md` | Implementation timeline, milestones, and priorities |
| `framework-evaluation.md` | Evaluation of Ratatui vs. other terminal UI frameworks |

## Key Architecture Concepts

The Squirrel UI is structured into several key layers:

1. **Application Layer**: Core application management and coordination
2. **Screen Layer**: Full-screen interfaces for different functionality
3. **Container Layer**: Layout components for organizing UI elements
4. **Widget Layer**: Individual interactive UI elements

These layers work together to create a composable, maintainable UI system.

## Implementation Strategy

The implementation follows a phased approach:

1. **Phase 1**: Core infrastructure and terminal integration
2. **Phase 2**: Essential UI components and screens
3. **Phase 3**: Advanced components and visualization
4. **Phase 4**: Polish, optimization, and accessibility

See `implementation-roadmap.md` for detailed timelines and milestones.

## Technology Stack

The UI is implemented using:

- **Ratatui**: Terminal UI framework for rendering and layout
- **Crossterm**: Cross-platform terminal control and event handling
- **Tokio**: Async runtime for non-blocking operations
- **Syntect**: Syntax highlighting for code display

## Integration with Core Features

The UI integrates with these Squirrel components:

- **Command System**: For command execution and history
- **Context Management**: For context visualization and editing
- **MCP Protocol**: For tool execution and visualization
- **Error Management**: For error display and recovery

## Getting Started

For developers working on the Squirrel UI:

1. Review the `component-architecture.md` document to understand the overall structure
2. See `ratatui-integration.md` for technical implementation details
3. Follow the `implementation-roadmap.md` for development priorities

## Future Directions

While the current specifications focus on the terminal UI, future versions may explore:

- Web-based UI options
- GUI interfaces for specific platforms
- Mobile interfaces
- Integration with IDEs and editors
