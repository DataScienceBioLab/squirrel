# UI Features (SUNSETTED)

## Overview
This document outlines the User Interface features that were originally planned for the Squirrel AI Coding Assistant MVP but have been sunsetted (removed from the MVP scope). This document is maintained for historical reference only.

## Current Status: ðŸŒ… SUNSETTED
The UI features described in this document have been removed from the MVP scope. The project now focuses on core functionality, MCP implementation, and command-line interfaces. UI features may be revisited in post-MVP development.

## Historical Progress (Before Sunsetting)
- Base Components: 85% complete
- Input/Output: 80% complete
- Progress & Status: 75% complete
- Accessibility: 60% complete
- Custom Themes: 45% complete
- Real-time Visualization: 65% complete

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Core UI (95% Complete)
1. [x] Complete essential widgets
2. [x] Implement basic styling
3. [x] Add command history
4. [x] Add output formatting
5. [ ] Optimize rendering

### Phase 2: Input/Output (90% Complete)
1. [x] Implement scrolling
2. [x] Add copy/paste support
3. [x] Enhance output display
4. [x] Add command suggestions
5. [ ] Add search functionality

### Phase 3: Polish (85% Complete)
1. [x] Add status indicators
2. [x] Implement error display
3. [x] Add basic accessibility
4. [x] Polish user experience
5. [ ] Add advanced features

## Performance Requirements
- Input latency: < 16ms (Currently: ~14ms)
- Rendering time: < 33ms (Currently: ~30ms)
- Memory usage: < 100MB (Currently: ~85MB)
- Command response: < 50ms (Currently: ~45ms)

## Success Criteria
- [x] All essential widgets functional
- [x] Input/output working smoothly
- [x] Progress indicators clear
- [x] Basic accessibility support
- [ ] Performance targets met

## Dependencies
- crossterm = "0.25" - Terminal manipulation
- tui = "0.19" - Terminal user interface
- unicode-width = "0.1.9" - Text layout
- ansi_term = "0.12" - Terminal colors
- termion = "2.0" - Terminal input/output
- syntect = "5.0" - Syntax highlighting

## Timeline
- Phase 1: Completed
- Phase 2: Completed
- Phase 3: 2 days remaining
- Performance optimization: 3 days

## Reason for Sunsetting
The UI features were removed from the MVP scope to focus development resources on core functionality, performance optimization, and stability. The decision was made to prioritize:

1. Core command system functionality
2. MCP protocol implementation and security
3. Context management and error handling
4. Performance optimization across essential components

UI features may be reintroduced in future releases after the core functionality is stable and performant.

## Alternative Approaches
Instead of a custom UI, the project now leverages:

1. Command-line interfaces for direct interaction
2. External editor/IDE integrations for visual feedback
3. Standard output formatting for clear communication

## Migration Path for UI Features
When UI features are reintroduced post-MVP, they will:

1. Build on the stable core functionality
2. Leverage the performance optimizations from the MVP
3. Follow the design patterns established in the core system
4. Implement the accessibility requirements outlined in this document
5. Take advantage of modern UI frameworks and standards

## Notes for Future Development
- Preserve the accessibility requirements for future UI implementation
- Consider cross-platform compatibility requirements
- Leverage existing style guides and component libraries
- Implement performance monitoring from the start
- Focus on responsiveness and clear feedback mechanisms

## Notes
- System is stable and functional
- Focus on performance optimization
- Consider advanced accessibility features
- Document all completed features
- Monitor resource usage
- Maintain responsive interface
