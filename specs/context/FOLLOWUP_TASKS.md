# Context Management System: Follow-up Tasks

## Documentation Updates

### API Documentation
- [ ] Update API documentation for Context Manager
- [ ] Update API documentation for Context Tracker
- [ ] Update API documentation for Context Adapter
- [ ] Update API documentation for Recovery system

### Concurrent Access Documentation
- [ ] Document lock usage patterns
- [ ] Document concurrent access patterns
- [ ] Document performance considerations
- [ ] Add usage examples demonstrating proper concurrent access

### Implementation Notes
- [ ] Document refactoring changes
- [ ] Document lock usage patterns
- [ ] Document performance characteristics

## Additional Testing

### Performance Testing
- [ ] Create performance benchmarks for core operations
- [ ] Measure lock contention under high load
- [ ] Create benchmarks comparing before/after refactoring
- [ ] Document performance results

### Load Testing
- [ ] Implement high concurrency load tests
- [ ] Test with multiple concurrent clients
- [ ] Measure resource usage under load
- [ ] Document scalability characteristics

## Future Enhancements

### Storage Options
- [ ] Investigate additional storage backends
- [ ] Implement pluggable storage system
- [ ] Add cloud storage integration
- [ ] Support distributed state storage

### Recovery Mechanisms
- [ ] Implement more sophisticated recovery techniques
- [ ] Add automatic failure detection
- [ ] Support differential state recovery

### Metrics and Monitoring
- [ ] Add comprehensive metrics collection
- [ ] Implement performance monitoring
- [ ] Track resource usage

## Timeline

- Documentation Updates: 1-2 days
- Additional Testing: 2-3 days
- Future Enhancements: Post-MVP

## Notes

The core implementation of the context management system is complete and functional. All tests are passing, including the newly added concurrent tests. The focus now is on improving documentation and adding more comprehensive testing.
