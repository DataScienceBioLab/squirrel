# Async Mutex Refactoring Progress

## Files to Refactor

### 1. `crates/context/src/manager/mod.rs`
- [x] Already using `tokio::sync::RwLock` for contexts
- [x] Already using `tokio::sync::Mutex` as AsyncMutex
- [x] Restructured code to avoid holding locks across await points in:
  - [x] `create_context`
  - [x] `update_context_state`
  - [x] `delete_context`
  - [x] Removed unnecessary async_lock usage
  - [x] Improved lock scoping with explicit drop points

### 2. `crates/context/src/tracker.rs`
- [x] Already using `tokio::sync::Mutex` for state
- [x] Already using `tokio::sync::RwLock` for active_context_id and last_sync
- [x] Restructured code to avoid holding locks across await points in:
  - [x] `update_state`
  - [x] `sync_state`
  - [x] Improved lock scoping with explicit drop points
  - [x] Separated read and write operations
  - [x] Removed unnecessary lock holding

### 3. `crates/context-adapter/src/adapter.rs`
- [x] Already using `tokio::sync::RwLock` for config and contexts
- [x] Restructured code to avoid holding locks across await points in:
  - [x] `create_context`
  - [x] `cleanup_expired_contexts`
  - [x] Improved lock scoping with explicit drop points
  - [x] Separated read and write operations
  - [x] Minimized lock duration

## Implementation Plan

1. **Phase 1: Context Manager Refactoring** ✅
   - [x] Restructured methods to avoid holding locks across await points
   - [x] Improved lock scoping
   - [x] Removed unnecessary async locks
   - [ ] Update documentation
   - [x] Add tests for concurrent access

2. **Phase 2: Context Tracker Refactoring** ✅
   - [x] Already using tokio mutexes
   - [x] Restructured methods to avoid holding locks across await points
   - [x] Improved lock scoping
   - [x] Separated read and write operations
   - [ ] Update documentation
   - [x] Add tests

3. **Phase 3: Context Adapter Refactoring** ✅
   - [x] Already using tokio mutexes
   - [x] Restructured methods to avoid holding locks across await points
   - [x] Improved lock scoping
   - [x] Separated read and write operations
   - [ ] Update documentation
   - [x] Add tests

## Progress Updates

### 2024-03-28
- Started refactoring planning
- Created progress tracking document
- Identified files requiring changes
- Completed context manager refactoring:
  - Restructured all methods to avoid holding locks across await points
  - Removed unnecessary async_lock usage
  - Improved lock scoping with explicit drop points
  - Separated read and write operations
- Completed context tracker refactoring:
  - Verified already using tokio mutexes
  - Restructured methods to avoid holding locks across await points
  - Improved lock scoping with explicit drop points
  - Separated read and write operations
  - Removed unnecessary lock holding
- Completed context adapter refactoring:
  - Verified already using tokio mutexes
  - Restructured methods to avoid holding locks across await points
  - Improved lock scoping with explicit drop points
  - Separated read and write operations
  - Minimized lock duration

### 2024-03-29
- Added comprehensive tests for concurrent access patterns:
  - Created test suite for concurrent context operations
  - Added tests for concurrent reads and writes
  - Added tests for mass concurrent context creation
  - Added tests for concurrent same-context updates
  - Added tests for concurrent recovery points
  - All concurrent tests passing successfully

## Next Steps

1. Update documentation for all components to reflect changes:
   - Context manager
   - Context tracker
   - Context adapter

2. ~~Add tests for concurrent access patterns:~~
   - ~~Test lock behavior~~
   - ~~Test state consistency~~
   - ~~Test error conditions~~
   - ~~Test performance under load~~

3. Update API documentation to reflect new patterns:
   - Document lock usage
   - Document concurrent access
   - Document performance considerations

## Testing Strategy

1. Unit tests for each refactored component ✅
   - [x] Test concurrent access patterns
   - [x] Verify lock behavior
   - [x] Test error conditions
   - [x] Test state consistency

2. Integration tests for concurrent access ✅
   - [x] Multiple clients accessing same context
   - [x] Concurrent create/update/delete operations
   - [x] High concurrency load testing

3. Performance benchmarks before and after
   - Measure lock contention
   - Measure operation latency
   - Measure resource usage

4. Load testing under high concurrency
   - Simulate multiple clients
   - Test state consistency
   - Monitor resource usage

## Documentation Updates Needed

1. Update API documentation
   - Document concurrent access patterns
   - Document lock behavior
   - Update method documentation

2. Update implementation notes
   - Document refactoring changes
   - Document lock usage patterns
   - Document performance considerations

3. Add concurrent usage examples
   - Show proper lock usage
   - Show error handling
   - Show state management

4. Document performance characteristics
   - Lock contention patterns
   - Resource usage patterns
   - Scaling considerations
