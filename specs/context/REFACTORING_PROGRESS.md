# Async Mutex Refactoring Progress

## Files to Refactor

### 1. `crates/context/src/manager/mod.rs`
- [x] Already using `tokio::sync::RwLock` for contexts
- [x] Already using `tokio::sync::Mutex` as AsyncMutex
- [x] Restructured code to avoid holding locks across await points in:
  - [x] `create_context`
  - [x] `update_context_state`
  - [x] `delete_context`
  - [x] Removed unnecessary async_lock usage
  - [x] Improved lock scoping with explicit drop points

### 2. `crates/context/src/tracker.rs`
- [x] Already using `tokio::sync::Mutex` for state
- [x] Already using `tokio::sync::RwLock` for active_context_id and last_sync
- [x] Restructured code to avoid holding locks across await points in:
  - [x] `update_state`
  - [x] `sync_state`
  - [x] Improved lock scoping with explicit drop points
  - [x] Separated read and write operations
  - [x] Removed unnecessary lock holding

### 3. `crates/context-adapter/src/adapter.rs`
- [x] Already using `tokio::sync::RwLock` for config and contexts
- [x] Restructured code to avoid holding locks across await points in:
  - [x] `create_context`
  - [x] `cleanup_expired_contexts`
  - [x] Improved lock scoping with explicit drop points
  - [x] Separated read and write operations
  - [x] Minimized lock duration

## Implementation Plan

1. **Phase 1: Context Manager Refactoring** ✅

   - [x] Update documentation
   - [x] Add tests

## Progress Updates

### 2024-03-28
- Started refactoring planning
- Created progress tracking document
- Identified files requiring changes
- Completed context manager refactoring:
  - Restructured all methods to avoid holding locks across await points
  - Removed unnecessary async_lock usage
  - Improved lock scoping with explicit drop points
  - Separated read and write operations
- Completed context tracker refactoring:
  - Verified already using tokio mutexes
  - Restructured methods to avoid holding locks across await points
  - Improved lock scoping with explicit drop points
  - Separated read and write operations
  - Removed unnecessary lock holding
- Completed context adapter refactoring:

### 2024-03-29
- Added comprehensive tests for concurrent access patterns:
  - Created test suite for concurrent context operations
  - Added tests for concurrent reads and writes
  - Added tests for mass concurrent context creation
  - Added tests for concurrent same-context updates
  - Added tests for concurrent recovery points
  - All concurrent tests passing successfully

### 2024-03-30
- Completed documentation updates:
  - Added module-level documentation about lock usage
  - Updated method-level documentation with locking patterns
  - Created usage examples demonstrating proper concurrent access
  - Added async lock best practices guide in README
  - Created performance benchmarks for measuring refactoring impact
  - Updated follow-up tasks and refactoring progress documents

## Next Steps

1. ~~Update documentation for all components to reflect changes:~~
   - ~~Context manager~~
   - ~~Context tracker~~
   - ~~Context adapter~~

2. ~~Add tests for concurrent access patterns:~~
   - ~~Test lock behavior~~
   - ~~Test state consistency~~
   - ~~Test error conditions~~
   - ~~Test performance under load~~

3. ~~Update API documentation to reflect new patterns:~~
   - ~~Document lock usage~~
   - ~~Document concurrent access~~
   - ~~Document performance considerations~~

4. Complete performance testing:
   - Run benchmarks to measure contention
   - Compare pre-refactoring and post-refactoring performance
   - Document performance improvements

## Testing Strategy

1. Unit tests for each refactored component ✅
   - [x] Test concurrent access patterns
   - [x] Verify lock behavior
   - [x] Test error conditions
   - [x] Test state consistency

2. Integration tests for concurrent access ✅
   - [x] Multiple clients accessing same context
   - [x] Concurrent create/update/delete operations
   - [x] High concurrency load testing

3. Performance benchmarks before and after
   - [x] Create benchmark framework
   - [ ] Measure lock contention
   - [ ] Measure operation latency
   - [ ] Measure resource usage

4. Load testing under high concurrency
   - [x] Implement high concurrency simulation
   - [ ] Test state consistency
   - [ ] Monitor resource usage

## Documentation Updates Completed

1. API documentation ✅
   - [x] Document concurrent access patterns
   - [x] Document lock behavior
   - [x] Update method documentation

2. Implementation notes ✅
   - [x] Document refactoring changes
   - [x] Document lock usage patterns
   - [x] Document performance considerations

3. Usage examples ✅
   - [x] Show proper lock usage
   - [x] Show error handling
   - [x] Show state management

4. Performance documentation
   - [x] Create benchmarks for measuring performance
   - [ ] Document performance characteristics
   - [ ] Document scaling considerations

## Current Status

The async mutex refactoring is now complete with all code changes implemented and tested. Documentation has been updated to reflect the changes and provide guidance on proper concurrent access patterns. Performance benchmarks have been created and are ready for final measurements.
