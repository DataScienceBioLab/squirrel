# Squirrel Design Patterns

This directory contains documentation for standardized design patterns to be used across the Squirrel codebase. Following these patterns ensures consistency, maintainability, and reduces cognitive overhead for developers working across different parts of the system.

## Available Patterns

| Pattern | Purpose | Key Concepts |
|---------|---------|-------------|
| [Dependency Injection](./dependency-injection.md) | Manage service dependencies | Constructor injection, service registry, lifecycle management |
| [Error Handling](./error-handling.md) | Standardized error management | Error types, propagation, context enrichment, thiserror |
| [Async Programming](./async-programming.md) | Consistent asynchronous code | Tokio runtime, futures, cancellation, backpressure |
| [Resource Management](./resource-management.md) | Safe resource lifecycle | RAII pattern, Drop trait, resource pooling, cleanup |
| [Schema Design](./schema-design.md) | Data structure standardization | Type safety, validation, serialization, versioning |

## When to Use These Patterns

These patterns should be applied consistently across the codebase to ensure:

1. **Consistency**: Developers can expect the same approach to common problems
2. **Maintainability**: Code follows established practices that are well-understood
3. **Quality**: Implementation follows best practices for reliability and performance
4. **Onboarding**: New developers can quickly understand the codebase

## Pattern Documentation Structure

Each pattern document follows a consistent structure:

1. **Context**: When and why the pattern is useful
2. **Implementation**: How to apply the pattern in our codebase
3. **Benefits & Tradeoffs**: Why we've chosen this approach
4. **Examples**: Concrete examples from our codebase
5. **Testing Approach**: How to test implementations of the pattern
6. **Security & Performance**: Considerations for these cross-cutting concerns
7. **Migration Guide**: How to refactor existing code to use the pattern

## Contributing New Patterns

To propose a new pattern:

1. Use the [PATTERN_TEMPLATE.md](./PATTERN_TEMPLATE.md) as a starting point
2. Fill in all sections with detailed guidance specific to the Squirrel codebase
3. Provide concrete examples from the existing codebase or illustrative examples
4. Submit the pattern for review
5. Once approved, add it to this README

## Pattern Governance

Patterns are maintained by the architecture team. Changes to existing patterns should go through review to ensure backward compatibility and alignment with the system architecture.
