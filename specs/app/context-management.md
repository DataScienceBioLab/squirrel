# Context Management System Specification

## Overview
The context management system provides comprehensive tracking, persistence, and synchronization of application state and context across the Groundhog AI Coding Assistant. It ensures reliable state management, error recovery, and real-time updates across the system.

## Core Components

### 1. Context State Management
```rust
pub struct ContextState {
    pub version: u64,
    pub data: Value,
    pub last_modified: SystemTime,
}

pub struct ContextSnapshot {
    pub id: String,
    pub timestamp: SystemTime,
    pub state: ContextState,
    pub metadata: Option<serde_json::Value>,
}
```

#### Responsibilities
- Versioned state tracking
- Immutable state snapshots
- Metadata management
- Timestamp-based tracking

### 2. Context Tracker
```rust
pub struct ContextTracker {
    state: Arc<RwLock<ContextState>>,
    history: VecDeque<ContextSnapshot>,
    subscribers: Vec<Box<dyn ContextSubscriber>>,
}
```

#### Core Features
- Thread-safe state management
- Historical state preservation
- Event notification system
- State change validation
- Rollback capabilities

### 3. Error Handling
```rust
pub enum ContextError {
    InvalidState(String),
    RecoveryError(String),
    PersistenceError(String),
    SnapshotNotFound,
    NoValidSnapshot,
}
```

#### Error Management
- Comprehensive error types
- Detailed error context
- Recovery mechanisms
- Error propagation

### 4. Event Subscription
```rust
pub trait ContextSubscriber: Send + Sync {
    fn on_state_change(&self, old_state: &ContextState, new_state: &ContextState);
    fn on_error(&self, error: &ContextError);
}
```

#### Subscription Features
- Real-time state change notifications
- Error event propagation
- Thread-safe subscriber management
- Custom subscriber implementations

## Subsystems

### 1. Persistence Layer
- Reliable state storage
- Snapshot management
- Data integrity validation
- Efficient serialization
- Recovery mechanisms

### 2. Synchronization System
- State synchronization
- Conflict detection and resolution
- Real-time state propagation
- Version reconciliation

### 3. Recovery System
- Automatic state recovery
- Snapshot restoration
- Error recovery procedures
- Data consistency validation

## Implementation Guidelines

### State Management
1. All state changes must be atomic
2. State versions must be monotonically increasing
3. Snapshots must be immutable
4. State changes must be validated before application

### Error Handling
1. All errors must be properly categorized
2. Error context must be preserved
3. Recovery procedures must be defined
4. Error events must be propagated to subscribers

### Synchronization
1. State changes must be propagated in order
2. Conflicts must be detected and resolved
3. Version conflicts must be reconciled
4. Network failures must be handled gracefully

### Recovery
1. System must maintain recoverable state
2. Recovery procedures must be atomic
3. Data consistency must be verified
4. Recovery events must be logged

## Performance Requirements

### Response Times
- State updates: < 50ms
- Snapshot creation: < 100ms
- State rollback: < 200ms
- Error recovery: < 500ms

### Resource Usage
- Memory footprint: < 100MB
- History size: configurable, default 1000 entries
- Snapshot size: < 1MB per snapshot

## Security Considerations

### Data Protection
1. All persistent data must be encrypted
2. Access control must be enforced
3. State modifications must be authenticated
4. Sensitive data must be properly handled

### Audit Trail
1. All state changes must be logged
2. Error events must be recorded
3. Recovery actions must be documented
4. Security events must be tracked

## Testing Requirements

### Unit Tests
1. All core components must have comprehensive tests
2. Error conditions must be tested
3. Edge cases must be covered
4. Performance requirements must be verified

### Integration Tests
1. Component interactions must be tested
2. System-wide scenarios must be covered
3. Error propagation must be verified
4. Recovery procedures must be validated

## Implementation Status
