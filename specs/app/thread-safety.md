# Thread Safety Specification

## System Overview
The thread safety system ensures proper synchronization and concurrent access patterns across the application. It provides thread-safe primitives and patterns for managing shared state and resources.

## Implementation Status: ✅ COMPLETED

### Core Features
- ✅ Thread-safe configuration management
- ✅ Thread-safe command handling
- ✅ Thread-safe hook system
- ✅ Thread-safe error handling
- ✅ Thread-safe state management
- ✅ Thread-safe resource access

### Thread-Safe Structures
```rust
// Thread-safe configuration
pub struct Core {
    config: Arc<RwLock<Config>>,
    version: String,
}

// Thread-safe command handling
pub struct CommandHandler {
    handlers: Arc<RwLock<HashMap<String, Box<dyn CommandProcessor>>>>,
}

// Thread-safe hook system
pub struct CommandHook {
    pre_hooks: Arc<RwLock<Vec<Box<dyn CommandProcessor>>>>,
    post_hooks: Arc<RwLock<Vec<Box<dyn CommandProcessor>>>>,
}
```
