### Dependency Management Rules

1. **Version Consistency**
   - All shared dependencies must use the same version across worktrees
   - Version updates must be coordinated across teams
   - Version conflicts must be resolved in the main workspace

2. **Feature Selection**
   - Feature flags must be explicitly declared
   - Avoid enabling unnecessary features
   - Document required features in specs

3. **Testing Dependencies**
   - Use consistent testing frameworks
   - Maintain separate dev-dependencies section
   - Follow common testing patterns

## UI Component Standards

### Terminal UI
- Use `ratatui` for all terminal UI components
- Follow consistent styling patterns
- Implement proper error handling
- Support cross-platform operation

### Component Guidelines
1. **Layout**
   - Use consistent constraints
   - Implement responsive designs
   - Follow established patterns

2. **Styling**
   - Use theme-based colors
   - Support light/dark modes
   - Maintain consistent borders

3. **Input Handling**
   - Implement consistent key bindings
   - Support configurable shortcuts
   - Handle Unicode properly

## Build and Quality Standards

### Clippy Configuration
```toml
[workspace.metadata.clippy]
warn = [
    "all",
    "correctness",
    "suspicious",
    "complexity",
    "perf",
    "style"
]
deny = [
    "unsafe_code",
    "deprecated",
    "unused_imports"
]
```

### Build Requirements
1. Zero Clippy warnings
2. Complete documentation
3. Comprehensive test coverage
4. Cross-platform compatibility

## Version Control Standards

### Branch Organization
- Main branch: Stable releases
- Development branch: Integration
- Feature branches: Team-specific work

### Commit Standards
- Follow conventional commits
- Include issue references
- Document breaking changes

## Implementation Timeline

### Phase 1: Dependency Standardization
- Duration: 1 week
- Tasks:
  - Audit current dependencies
  - Resolve version conflicts
  - Update workspace manifest
  - Verify builds across teams

### Phase 2: UI Migration

## Crates Organization

### Overview
The `groundhog/crates/` directory contains various crates that are integral to the Groundhog project. These crates are designed to encapsulate specific functionalities and can be reused across different parts of the project.

### Key Features
- Modular design for easy integration
- Encapsulation of specific functionalities
- Reusable components across the project

### Usage Guidelines
- Each crate within the `groundhog/crates/` directory is self-contained and follows the standard Rust crate structure.
- Teams should refer to the `Cargo.toml` files within each crate for dependency management and feature flags.
- Direct interaction with these crates is not required unless specified in the project specifications.

### Integration Points
- The crates are integrated with the main workspace and follow the same versioning and dependency management rules as other components.
- Ensure that any updates to the crates are coordinated with the relevant teams to maintain consistency.
