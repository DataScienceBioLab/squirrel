# Adapter Initialization Checks

This document summarizes the implementation of explicit initialization checks in the Context and Commands module adapters as part of the dependency injection migration.

## Overview

Proper initialization checks are a critical part of dependency injection patterns. They ensure that adapters are not used before they are properly initialized, preventing runtime errors and improving error messages. These checks were added to the following adapters:

1. CommandRegistryAdapter
2. CommandHandlerAdapter
3. MCPContextAdapter (already had proper checks)
4. ContextAdapter (already had proper checks)
5. MCPProtocolAdapter (already had proper checks)

## Implementation Details

### CommandRegistryAdapter

The CommandRegistryAdapter was modified to include:
- An Optional inner field rather than a directly initialized field
- A new `initialize()` method that sets up the inner registry
- An `is_initialized()` method to check initialization state
- Added `CommandRegistryAdapterError` enum with `NotInitialized` and `AlreadyInitialized` variants
- All methods now check for initialization before proceeding
- Factory function `create_initialized_registry_adapter()` for creating pre-initialized adapters
- Updated `create_registry_adapter_with_registry()` to properly handle existing registry instances

### CommandHandlerAdapter

The CommandHandlerAdapter was modified to include:
- Changed the `get_handler()` method to return a Result instead of creating a handler on demand
- Added an `initialize()` method that properly initializes the inner handler
- Added an `is_initialized()` method to check initialization state
- Added `CommandHandlerAdapterError` enum with `NotInitialized` and `AlreadyInitialized` variants
- All methods now check for initialization before proceeding
- Factory function `create_initialized_handler_adapter()` for creating pre-initialized adapters

### Testing

Unit tests were added for both adapters to verify:
- Initialization works correctly and can be checked
- Operations fail with appropriate errors when adapters are not initialized
- Factory functions work correctly
- Attempting to initialize an already initialized adapter fails with the expected error

## Benefits

The explicit initialization checks provide several benefits:
1. **Clear Error Messages:** When an operation is attempted on an uninitialized adapter, a specific error message indicates the problem.
2. **Proper DI Pattern:** Separating creation from initialization follows proper dependency injection patterns.
3. **Testability:** The code is now more testable, as we can verify the behavior of adapters in both initialized and uninitialized states.
4. **Consistency:** All adapters now follow the same pattern, making the codebase more maintainable.

## Next Steps

With the adapter initialization checks in place, the next steps in the dependency injection migration are:
1. Perform a comprehensive audit of the app module
2. Ensure proper error handling across all components
3. Run a full test suite to verify all changes work correctly
4. Update the documentation to reflect the new patterns
